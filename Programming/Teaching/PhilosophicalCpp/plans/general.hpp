  \brief General plans on teaching C++ "philosophically"


  \todo No "useful" programs!
  <ul>
   <li> There exists enough example programs (which are actually
   un-professional and useless). </li>
   <li> Here systematic playing. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Using the right tools (nearly) from the beginning!
  <ul>
   <li> With buildsystem, testsystem, and version control. </li>
   <li> The version control is implicit in the OKlibrary, so we don't
   need to do something special here. </li>
   <li> The makefiles should perhaps always be available as independent
   makefiles, but we should also supply tools for using the buildsystem
   of the OKlibrary. </li>
   <li> Of course, the makefiles we provide lead to the OKlibrary-buildsystem.
   </li>
   <li> For the testsystem, we build up a simple higher-order system (nearly
   no automation), which then at some point is replaced by the OKlibrary
   testsystem. </li>
   <li> So again this system needs to lead to the OKlibrary. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Anticipated parts
  <ul>
   <li> In this order:
    <ol>
     <li> Basics </li>
     <li> Types </li>
     <li> Functions </li>
     <li> Classes </li>
     <li> Templates </li>
     <li> Expressions </li>
     <li> Declarations </li>
     <li> Statements </li>
     <li> Preprocessor </li>
     <li> Exceptions </li>
     <li> Names </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Should we also put the standard library into this "philosophical"
   part? </li>
   <li> And what about the design techniques? </li>
  </ul>

  \file Programming/InputOutput/plans/general.hpp
  \brief Plans for the module on general input and output facilities


  \todo Transfer the module to part Programming. DONE
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (now just "InputOutput")
   Perhaps the module-name "GeneralInputOutput" is not really
   adequate ? At least doxygen has problem with it in connection with
   "InputOutput" (same suffix). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update namespaces


  \todo Update namespace-usage


  \todo Complete doxygen-documentation


  \todo Update plans
  Write plans for all submodules and transfer all todo's:
  <ul>
   <li> IOStreamFilters : </li>
   <li> IOStreamSinks : </li>
   <li> Multiplexer : </li>
   <li> RecursiveDirectoryIteration : (%boost can now be used here,
        and the bug should be handled) </li>
   <li> MatchFiles : (shall move to applications-sub-directory,
        or perhaps to a Tools-directory) </li>
   <li> PathDifference : (same as MatchFiles) </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Move Refactoring/BoostPathCorrected.hpp to here.


  \todo Write docus


  \todo Write demos


  \todo New tests
  Transfer the tests to the new test system

      \brief The list of constants naming the available levels of expliciteness for messages

      OKLIB_STRATA is a sequence in the sense of the Boost Preprocessor library. If a new element
      is added (for a new level; at the end or in the middle -- but not at the start, since
      otherwise it would replace the default level), then in order to make it usable, a new partial
      specialisation of ::OKlib::Messages::S needs to be created (see below), and in
      ::OKlib::Messages::Documentation::LevelNames a new print-overload for this class
      has to be created as well as extending the switch-statements of the other print-overloads.

      The standard consists of the levels Basic, Full, and Extensive.

      Associated message services one finds in Messages/messages/Levels.hpp.

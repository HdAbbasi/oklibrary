  \brief General plans regarding generic algorithms for comparing sequences


  \todo Move parts of General/Algorithms.hpp to here.


  \todo Should module Iterators be included here?


  \todo We do not use Boost here, but the test system --- shouldn't
  then the test system not arrange for including the Boost library,
  not the user of the test library?


  \todo Consolidate tests.


  \todo Write docus.

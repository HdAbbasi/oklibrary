  \brief Plans regarding generic algorithms for comparing sequences


  \todo Completing CommonPart
  (for Sequences/_Comparisons/CommonPart.hpp)
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps we better output a triple, where the third component
   is the size of common sequence found. Then the default
   implementation should also be our own. </li>
   <li> Remove the asymmetry in the output, that is, output a pair
   of iterators : DONE </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Testing CommonPart


  \todo Documenting CommonPart
  <ul>
   <li> Write docus. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for the module on components for finding all
  satisfying assignments.
  \todo The first approach is to find an equivalent DNF
  by DPLL (without further simplification it will actually
  compute a hitting DNF).
  \todo See HypergraphTransversals/DirectTransversalEnumeration.hpp
  for the problem of finding all minimal satisfying assignments.
  \todo Another approach is using OBDD's (this should likely go
  into its own module).

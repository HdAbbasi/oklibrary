  \brief Plans for the module with tree datastructures
  \todo In a module GraphTrees rooted trees as Boost-graphs
  with one distinguished vertex establishing, while Parent-graph-trees
  additionally are equipped for every vertex with a property yielding the
  parent vertex (which in case of the root is the root itself).

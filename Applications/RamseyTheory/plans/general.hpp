  \brief Plans for the module on %Ramsey theory (especially
  van der Waerden's problem)


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo %Ramsey theory:
  We need generators for all types of Ramsey-problems; for van der Waerden's problem we already started.
  Such translators should only produce a hypergraph-colouring problem (to be handled then by the
  general translations in module HypergraphColouring).


  \todo Transfer:
  Transferring (and updating) generators for
  <ul>
   <li> OKsolver/Experimental/Transformationen/Ramsey </li>
   <li> OKsolver/Experimental/Transformationen/VanderWaerden </li>
  </ul>
  Especially  providing active clause-sets is very interesting.

  \brief Plans on the module on computing van der Waerden numbers


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/plans/VanderWaerdenProblems.hpp
   and
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/VanderWaerdenProblems.mac.

   </li>
   <li> See the various generators in Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Reactivate test system.


  \todo Update namespace.


  \todo New test system
  <ul>
   <li> Transform the tests to the new testsystem. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update
  <ul>
   <li> Transfer the todo's from
   Applications/RamseyTheory/Van_der_Waerden_hypergraph.hpp to here (thereby
   updating them). </li>
   <li> Likely this file should be renamed to VanderWaerdenHypergraphs.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> The generation of hypergraphs should be part of
   Combinatorics/Hypergraphs/Generators. </li>
   <li> So the content of this file should be moved to
   Combinatorics/Hypergraphs/Generators/plans/VanderWaerdenProblems.hpp. </li>
   <li> All the functionality like arithprog_primes_hg from the Maxima/Lisp
   level (and all the other functions there in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/VanderWaerdenProblems.mac)
   should be available there. </li>
  </ul>

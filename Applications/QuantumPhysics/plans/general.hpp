  \brief Plans regarding certain aspects of quantum physics (as applications
  of satisfiability)


  \todo Quantum simulation
  <ul>
   <li> It is claimed that quantum simulation cannot be performed "classically".
   How do such problems look like? Can we attack them? </li>
   <li> And we can a quantum computer be simulated? </li>
  </ul>

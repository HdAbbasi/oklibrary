  \module_version LatinSquares 0.0.3 (23.11.2006)


  \par Version 0.0.4

  \par
   In Applications/LatinSquares/plans/Sudoku.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Complete implementation of OKlib::LatinSquares::SudokuProblem.


  \par Version 0.0.5

  \par
   In Applications/LatinSquares/plans/Sudoku.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Complete implementation of OKlib::LatinSquares::Trivial_reduction_Sudoko.

  \todo
   Refine milestones.


  \par Version 0.1

  \par
   In Applications/LatinSquares/plans/Sudoku.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Test OKlib::LatinSquares::SudokuProblem
    - Test OKlib::LatinSquares::Trivial_reduction_Sudoko
    - Strong hypergraph colouring.


  \par Version 0.2

  \par
   In Applications/LatinSquares/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Review
    - Basic direct algorithms


  \par Version 0.3

  \par
   Basic implementations of LS(v_ij) are provided and tested:
    - the direct incoding as a clause-set (as always, non-boolean)
    - the direct encoding, but managed as a virtual clause-set


  \par Version 0.4
  A basic implementation of LS(v_ij) as an alliance of injectivity constraints
  is provided (just using basic components) and tested.


  \par Version 0.5
  A basic implementation MOS(v_ijk) as an alliance of injectivity constraints
  is provided and tested.


  \par Version 0.6
  A basic implementation MOLS(v_ijk) as an alliance of injectivity constraints
  is provided and tested.


  \par Version 1.0
  Interesting implementations and algorithms exist for LS, MOS and MOLS.

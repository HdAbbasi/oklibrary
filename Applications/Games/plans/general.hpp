  \brief Module for game playing and SAT


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo What other games are interesting?
  <ul>
   <li> Go seems to be too "strategical". </li>
   <li> "Nine men's morris" should be a solved game(?);
   this could be alright for SAT. </li>
   <li> Checkers should also be solved(?), and could pose
   some problems (interesting) due to the jump sequences. </li>
   <li> Backgammon perhaps involves too much special
   knowledge. </li>
   <li> "Tic, Tac, Toe" and generlisations could be a nice
   exercise. </li>
   <li> For Sudoku see module LatinSquares. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Kind of clear, that with (generalised) SAT, also
  with QBF, one does not get a "player", but only a
  "problem solver" --- can this be a subprocedure for
  a "player" ?

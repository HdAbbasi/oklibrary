  \brief Module for game playing via SAT (and beyond)


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo What other games are interesting?
  <ul>
   <li> Go seems to be too "strategical" (?). </li>
   <li> "Nine men's morris" ("Muehle" in German) should be a solved game(?);
   this could be alright for SAT. </li>
   <li> Checkers should also be solved(?), and could pose
   some problems (interesting) due to the jump sequences. </li>
   <li> Backgammon perhaps involves too much special knowledge. </li>
   <li> "Tic, Tac, Toe" and generalisations could be a nice exercise. </li>
   <li> For Sudoku see module LatinSquares. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo "Problem solver"
  <ul>
   <li> Kind of clear, that with (generalised) SAT, also
   with QBF, one does not get a "player", but only a
   "problem solver" --- can this be a subprocedure for
   a "player" ? </li>
   <li> Another aspect could be counting of solutions. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Tools for translations
  <ul>
   <li> We need some nice tools to ease the translations. </li>
   <li> One approach is via transition relations and model checking. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief %Algorithms to determine graph isomorphisms (directly or by reducing
  it to (generalised) SAT problems)


  Given two graphs G_1, G_2 together with maps v in V(G_1) -> D(v) <= V(G_2)
  specifying to which vertices v may me mapped, find a graph isomorphism from G_1
  to G_2 fulfilling these specifications.


  \todo The first step consists in applying algorithms which further reduce the sets D(v),
  for example by using that isomorphisms maintain vertex degrees. More generally,
  each vertex is labelled by some list of multisets of natural numbers, such that isomorphisms
  must maintain these lists; the first step is to use just the vertex degrees, the
  second step is to use for each vertex the multiset, which maps each possible
  vertex degree of a neighbour to the count of such neighbours; and so on (is
  this the idea of "Naughty" ?). Another possibility is to use adjacency relations: If w is
  adjacent to v, then for every value w' in D(w) there must exist a value v' in D(v) such that
  w' is adjacent to v'.
  Either such algorithms are processed up to a certain level, or "until they get stuck",
  and then the remaining problem is formulated as a satisfiability problem.

  \todo Then (still just given G_1, G_2 and D, but D may have been further refined
  by the previous step) we obtain a Verbund of virtual clause-sets with variable set V(G_1)
  and variable domains given by D, with members
  <ol>
   <li> BIJ(V(G_1), D, V(G_2)) (see module "Generators"). </li>
   <li> A virtual clause-set which in principal for every vertex v and set V of possible values
     can yield for every vertex w adjacent to v in G the set of possible values W given by
     the set of w' such that v' in V with {v',w'} in E(G_2) exists. Of main importance are the
     cases with |V| = 1 (these conditions ensure completeness of the translation).
     This virtual clause-set may also offer stronger inferences. In principal it is again
     an algorithm from the first step, processing a refined domain-assignment as input
     and computing further refinements. </li>
  </ol>
  This alliance then is passed to a SAT algorithm (or output, using the canonical
  clause-representation).


  \todo What about the graph embedding problem ? Should also be part of this module.

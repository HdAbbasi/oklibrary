  \brief General plans for the module on searching algebraic
  structures


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Besides groupoids (see plans/Groupoids.hpp), what
  other algebraic structures are amenable for (generalised)
  SAT ? One would think of semirings (but associativity
  could be a stumbling block here), or structures related
  to finite geometries.

  Also in the context of universal algebra a lot of
  "combinatorial" structures arise (where a SAT-approach
  could be succesful --- the more "mathematical" the less
  likely is a SAT approach to succeed).

  \brief The general principles of the OKlibrary


  \todo Improve the general design discussions
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (on the aims-page now is enough material)
   This should perhaps mainly concern the general ideas of the
   library, one (a4) page (at most) which explains what's it all
   about. </li>
   <li> DONE
   For the internet page we have already something (the introductory
   text), and we should expand on that, for the local home page. </li>
   <li> We have already the Aims-page:
    <ol>
     <li> DONE This page needs to be updated. </li>
     <li> And perhaps sub-divided into several pages (perhaps at present
     it is already too long). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE
   All the information which is on the Internet home page should
   also be available locally.
    <ol>
     <li> This concerns the sections "The public source-code repository",
     and "Remarks on the release process". </li>
     <li> Though specific information on the download process doesn't need to
     be provided locally. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans regarding the ticket system


  \todo Ranking
  <ul>
   <li> The running numbers gives a rough indication on the order of
   processing the tickets. </li>
   <li> In the fourth column we can use precise priority-specifications:
    <ol>
     <li> "A" means urgent, must be done as the next step. </li>
     <li> "B" means is also urgent, but might use a bit more time, since
     also some planning is involved. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

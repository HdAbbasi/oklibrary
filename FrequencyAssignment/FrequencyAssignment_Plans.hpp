  \brief Plans for the module on frequency assignment
  \todo First the most important notions of frequency assignments
  have to be captured and formulated as generalised satisfiability
  problems.
  \todo Find benchmark collections. Are there competitions on
  the subject? (We look only at the decision side; likely most
  activities in this field concentrate on optimisation?!)

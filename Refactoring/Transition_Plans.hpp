  \todo There needs to be some testing of the transition.
  \todo In Buildsystem/makefile the creation of the include directory and
  copying of headers and makefiles to this directory has to be removed. 
  (L22,L25,L27,L31,L41)
  \todo In Buildsystem/makefile_generic the definition of includedir should 
  now point to $(prefix)/OKsystem/Transitional. The copying of headers on 
  lines 242-245 is no longer required.

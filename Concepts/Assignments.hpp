  \brief Concepts for partial and total assignments.
  \todo Concepts for assignments as specialisations of concepts for maps (see my notes as discussed in the MSc thesis of B): If f is an assignment, then dom(f) is defined, and for v of type dom(f) the expression f(v) can be build (v is a variable with values, f(v) is of the value type). dom(f) is a set in the general sense (which can have iterators and element-decision). As a refinement iterators through all pairs (x, y) (so that std::map can easily yield models). See Clauses.hpp.

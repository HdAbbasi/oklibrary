  \brief Plans for the submodule on concept-related metafunctions

  \todo The file-documentation should contain some general explanations
  about the roles of the supplied metafunctions.

  \todo Transfer the tests to the new test-system.

  \todo Perhaps a metafunction computing the concept-tag-class from a concept
  class would  be useful?

  \todo Should tr1/type_traits completely replace boost/type_traits.hpp?

  \brief Plans for most basic concepts

  \todo Should the helper-classes for archetype-definitions (like Concepts::convertible_to_bool) go into their own file?

  \todo Should boost/type_traits.hpp be replaced by the tr1-components?

  \todo Perhaps the macros need some clean-up.

  \todo Transfer the tests to the new test system.

  \par Version history

   - 0.1   : 10.9.2006; initial version number (concepts are under work for around 2 years).
   - 0.1.1 : 9.12.2006; prototypes of concepts for variables, atomic conditions and literals developed.
   - 0.1.2 : 2.4.2007; all concepts cleaned-up, so that the todos are relevant, and the doxygen-documentation is well-readable. Now concept-development can really start (at the planning level, while yet the generic test system is not ready).

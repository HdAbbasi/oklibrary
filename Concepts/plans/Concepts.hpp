  \brief Plans for the concepts module

  \todo Update:
  The doxygen-documentation must be thorougly updated and expanded.
  And likely also the plans need a thorough update.

  \todo Warnings:
  Eliminate all warnings.

  \todo Tests:
  Move to the new test system.

  \todo Formulating concepts:
  What is the difference for example between
  bool b = static_cast<bool>(e);
  and
  bool b = e;
  ?! I would assume that here there is none. And in general?

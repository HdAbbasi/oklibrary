  \brief Concepts for bipartite graphs.
  \todo Concepts for bipartite graphs (with two vertex types), transferring as much as possible the concepts from the boost graph library. Related matrices: "reduced adjacency matrices".
  \todo Operations for changing bipartite graphs: Adding / deleting edges, and adding /
  deleting vertices (from both parts), and the corresponding undo-operations.
  \todo Literal-clause graphs and vertex-hyperede graphs yield bipartite graphs; for the former
  we have special relations between the literals (via the underlying variable).

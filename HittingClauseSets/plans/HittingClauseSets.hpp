  \brief General plans for the module on hitting clause-sets

  \todo Given a rooted tree, a corresponding SMUSAT_{delta=1} needs to
  to be constructed. Special cases for the full tree and the input tree.
  Perhaps this should go to a submodule RegularHittingClauseSets.

  \todo More generally, for an arbitrary rooted tree and a labelling of inner
  nodes with variables, such that no variable occurs twice on any path from
  the root to some leaf, construct the corresponding (tree-)hitting clause-set.

  \todo Likely, in this module also multi-hitting clause-sets should
  be considered (with non-boolean variables).

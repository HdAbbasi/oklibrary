  \brief SAT algorithms using enumeration.
  \todo Writing trivial SAT algorithm, using any enumeration; likely some kind
  of visitor concept is useful here.
  \todo Specialising the trivial algorithm by using Gray codes and a "flip operation"
  of the formula (which can be implemented efficiently using literal-clause graphs
  and storing information about the assignments for each clause; this data structure
  is also fundamental for local-search algorithms (and in general any algorithm using
  total assignments).
  \todo Another variation is the search for autarkies.

  \brief Plans for the module handling language names

  \todo Write tests (in the new test system).

  \todo OKlib::Messages::LanguageName just translates strings into the value
  given by the strings interpreted as constants --- isn't there some Boost
  component for that?

  \todo Once available (and having tests in place), the std::map in class
  Messages::LanguageName should be replaced by a hash map.

  \todo Finally, one should use a specialised string-matching algorithm (for realising the map
  in Messages::LanguageName).

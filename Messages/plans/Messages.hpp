  \brief Plans for the messages module

  \todo Testing:
   - We need here a preliminary compiler switch, which disables
     testing of fr_CA for versions different from 4.0.3 and 4.1.1.
     Later we will request compiler version 4.1.1 or higher,
     but first we have to see that there are no performance
     problems (regarding compilation and execution).

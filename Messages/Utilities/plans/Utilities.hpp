  \brief General plans for the Messages/Utilities module.
  \todo As a service for Testsystem/TestException_DesignStudy.hpp
  (and other parts of the test system) and for ProgramOptions we need
  classes (and macros) for file-identification purposes:
   - Per file we have __DATE__ (compilation date), __FILE__ (file name),
     __TIME__ (C) (compilation time), and
     $Date: 2006/03/02 18:25:54 $ (last change date), $Name:  $ (current tag), $Revision: 1.2 $ (current
     revision number) (CVS).
   - For programs we also have the version, the author, name of program etc.
 \todo Perhaps we can offer also some help regarding __LINE__.
 \todo We need components (message classes and handlers) for creating warning and error
 messages (using the abve facilities)
 \todo Module ErrorHandling should offer a base class using message objects.

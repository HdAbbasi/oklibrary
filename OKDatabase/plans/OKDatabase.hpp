  \brief Plans for the module concerning the random-formulas-database

  First the old module is transferred to the OKlibrary, and then
  it is extended.

  \todo Documentation:
  Add minimal doxygen-documentation to the C++ files.

  \todo OKgenerator:
  Connect to the module RandomGenerator (see RandomGenerator/plans/RandomGenerator.hpp), and to the old module OKsolver/Generator.
  This should concern mostly the tools for experiment-processing etc.
  Likely all those programs should be transferred to this module.

  \todo make:
  Shall we use the local postgresql-installation for compilation
  (as include-source)? Perhaps as the default.

  \todo Other files:
  How to treat the .dtd and .sql files?

  \todo Renaming:
  Once we can do directory-renaming with the version control system, this
  module should be renamed; possibilities:
  - OKdatabase
  - Database

  \brief Plans regarding the greedy graph colouring algorithm

  \todo GreedyColouring.cpp:
   - Output optionally all optimal orderings (or just one).
   - Use Messages.
   - Write components, so that the algorithms can be tested.
   - Doxygen documentation.

  \todo Search for literature on heuristics for vertex orderings; from
  CS-232 we have the traversing greedy colouring; it seems sensible to
  combine this with a largest degree first-stratey.

  \todo How do these algorithms translate into SAT algorithms?

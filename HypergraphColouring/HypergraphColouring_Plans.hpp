  \brief Plans for the module HypergraphColouring
  \todo Transferring (and updating) generators for
   - OKsolver/Experimental/Transformationen/Ramsey
   - OKsolver/Experimental/Transformationen/VanderWaerden
   (also providing active clause-sets).
  \todo Given a graph as input, translate the k-colouring problem into
  generalised or P-clause-sets.
  \todo Given a graph as input, translate the colouring problem into
  generalised or P-clause-sets.
  \todo For interesting systematically generated classes of graphs,
  create active clause-sets translating k-colouring problems.

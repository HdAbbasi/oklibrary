  \brief Plans regarding licences

  The basic decision is to use GPLv3 (http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html)


  \todo Further licence installations
  <ul>
   <li> Also html and tex files need the licence. </li>
   <li> Is it necessary that the licence is also visible on
   each document page ? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Licence maintenance
  <ul>
   <li> We must make sure, that every new non-data file gets the
   licence statement. </li>
   <li> When external developers check in new files, then those must have the
   OK-copyright etc. clause (otherwise the submission is rejected). </li>
   <li> We should also add the creation-information and licence to
   html-files. </li>
   <li> For every release, the year of the release must be added to every
   file's copyright notice (if not already present). This boils down to
   adding the new year to every copyright statement at the beginning
   of a new year. </li>
   <li> "AddLicence2" is more advanced than "AddLicence1", so the latter
   should be updated. </li>
   <li> Also a third type of script is needed for make-files. </li>
   <li> Important that these scripts tell us about "bad" files. </li>
   <li> Part of the licence must be that the full history is handed down. Is this
   guaranteed by the original text, or do we need to amend it?
    <ol>
     <li> E-mail was sent to FSL. </li>
     <li> No answer (6.10.2007); one should try it again. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>

  </ul>

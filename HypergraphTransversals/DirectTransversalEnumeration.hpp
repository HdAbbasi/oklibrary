  \brief Implementations of enumerations of hypergraph
  transversals based on the direct method.
  \todo Creating the concepts (the output, the transversal
  hypergraph, as container; for incrementell methods the
  iterator in it creates the next transversal "on the fly").
  \todo Implementing the naive method.
  \todo Apply it to compute all MUS's, given all MSS's.
  \todo Hypergraph traversal is a special case of "clause-set
  traversal", where for a clause-set the set of minimal satisfying
  partial assignments has to be computed. Via the embedding
  of hypergraphs into clause-sets as positive clause-sets, perhaps
  hypergraph transversal can be obtained as special case ?!
  For a clause-set F, let's call the set of minimal satisfying
  partial assignment also "Tr(F)".

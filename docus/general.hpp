  \brief The central docus-file for the library

  <h1> Overview on the docus-system </h1>

  <h2> Meaning </h2>

  The docus-system, which is available at (nearly) every node of the
  directory tree (following the hierarchical structure of the library),
  provides general usage information relevant for the respective
  level (the closer to the leaves of the tree the more specific).


  <h2> Sub-division </h2>

  The list of top-level docus pages for the parts of the library
  (UNDER CONSTRUCTION):
  <ul>
   <li> The build system : Buildsystem/docus/general.hpp </li>
   <li> The computer algebra system : ComputerAlgebra/docus/general.hpp </li>
  </ul>

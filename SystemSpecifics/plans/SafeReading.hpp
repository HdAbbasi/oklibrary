  \brief Plans for testing of reading fundamental types from istreams (for example, whether input representing nonrepresentable numbers are regocnised).
  \todo Write test cases according to my postings to the Boost
  mailing list (October 2005).
  \todo Another submodule needs to be created, which gives access
  to the platform specifics like __WORDSIZE.

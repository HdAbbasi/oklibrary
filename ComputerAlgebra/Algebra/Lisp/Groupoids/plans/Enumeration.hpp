  \brief Plans on enumerating groupoids


  \todo Complete the implementation
  <ul>
   <li> Write simple tests. DONE </li>
   <li> Move to dedicated module. DONE </li>
   <li> Complete the implementation according to "XXX". </li>
   <li> Write little helper functions for working with
   all_isotopismisomorphism_classes_actively_grd. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo All isomorphism types of small groupoids
  <ul>
   <li> We need representatives: Perhaps best the lexicographically smallest
   elements (using row-wise order). </li>
   <li> For the basic properties (associativity, unitality, commutativity,
   unique solvability, non-trivial automorphism group; together with all
   combinations) we need counts and representatives. </li>
   <li> We need also to build up catalogues. </li>
  </ul>

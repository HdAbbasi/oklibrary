  \brief Plans on general constructions for groupoids


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Products
  <ul>
   <li> We should also provide products of arbitrary arity. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE
  Complex composition
  <ul>
   <li> And given a groupoid, we can form its "complex groupoid", given by
   all subsets and the complex product (by all combinations).
   <li> Here it would be good if the base sets could be given lazily. </li>
   <li> How to achieve that?? </li>
   <li> Perhaps just the law of composition is given, and the base set is
   only implicitly given. </li>
  </ul>

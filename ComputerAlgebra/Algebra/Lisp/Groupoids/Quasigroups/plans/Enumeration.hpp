  \brief Plans regarding enumeration of quasi-groups


  \todo Enumeration and classification
  <ul>
   <li> For small order (say, n <= 5) it should be possible to enumerate
   all (isomorphism types) of quasigroups (and also the total count is
   interesting), and providing a catalogue. </li>
   <li> Of course, we also need the numbers (total and non-isomorphic) of
   unital quasigroups, groups, commutative quasigroups, unital commutative
   quasigroups, and commutative groups. </li>
   <li> Implement enumeration functions according to "All isomorphism types of
   small groupoids" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Algebra/Lisp/Groupoids/plans/Enumeration.hpp. </li>
   <li> What is the relation to the module for latin squares (see
   ComputerAlgebra/CombinatorialMatrices/Lisp/LatinSquares/plans/general.hpp)?
    <ol>
     <li> The general idea would be that here we enumerate everything with
     an "algebraic flavour", while there we handle everything with a
     "combinatorial flavour". </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>

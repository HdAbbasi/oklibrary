  \brief Plans in general regarding quasi-groups


  \todo Connections to other modules
  <ul>
   <li> See todo "Quasigroups" in
   Applications/AlgebraicStructures/plans/Groupoids.hpp. </li>
   <li> See
   ComputerAlgebra/CombinatorialMatrices/Lisp/LatinSquares/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Conversions
  <ul>
   <li> The conversions between quasigroups and latin squares work as well
   for the translation between groupoids and "composition tables". </li>
   <li> So perhaps we should generalisations (simply appropriately named)
   for this most general level. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Enumeration and classification
  <ul>
   <li> For small order (say, n <= 5) it should be possible to enumerate
   all (isomorphism types) of quasigroups (and also the total count is
   interesting), and providing a catalogue. </li>
   <li> Of course, we also need the numbers (total and non-isomorphic) of
   unital quasigroups, groups, commutative quasigroups, unital commutative
   quasigroups, and commutative groups. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans in general regarding quasi-groups


  \todo Connections to other modules
  <ul>
   <li> See todo "Quasigroups" in
   Applications/AlgebraicStructures/plans/Groupoids.hpp. </li>
   <li> See
   ComputerAlgebra/CombinatorialMatrices/Lisp/LatinSquares/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Conversions
  <ul>
   <li> The conversions between quasigroups and latin squares work as well
   for the translation between groupoids and "composition tables". </li>
   <li> So perhaps we should generalisations (simply appropriately named)
   for this most general level. </li>
  </ul>

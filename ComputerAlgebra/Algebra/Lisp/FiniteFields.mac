/* It appears you can not overload functions with different arities
   and so the gf_* functions have been prefixed with an 'e' for 
   extended. These functions perform the same duty as their gf_*
   counterparts but require additionally an argument that specifies
   which field the operation is being performed over in the form [p,n,ip] where
   "p" is the prime characteristic of the field, "n" is the power to which "p" 
   is raised, and "ip" the polynomial irreducible over GF(p) such that a field
   GF(p^n) is defined with operations being performed on polynomials over
   GF(p) modulo ip.

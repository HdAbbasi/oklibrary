  \brief User documentation for graphs in Lisp/Maxima


  <h2> General ideas </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> %Graphs are treated directly, very similar to the mathematical
   definition. </li>
   <li> The point is not efficient computation, but
    <ol>
     <li> readability of code </li>
     <li> ease of writing code. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The aim is to create a large collection of simple "procedural
   specifications" for all sorts of graph-related functionality. </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> Usage </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> See the Tutorial ComputerAlgebra/Graphs/Lisp/docus/Tutorial.hpp (by MH).
   </li>
   <li> The tutorial
   ComputerAlgebra/docus/CourseCombinatorics_LintWilson/index.hpp contains a
   lot of material related to graph theory in Maxima/Lisp. </li>
  </ul>

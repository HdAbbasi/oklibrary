  \brief Plans regarding trees (as combinatorial objects)


  \todo Isomorphism testing
  <ul>
   <li> We need a poly-time test for the isomorphism of trees. </li>
   <li> We need also to detect whether a graph is a pathgraph or
   a star. </li>
   <li> This seems to belong to Graphs/Lisp/Isomorphisms/Trees.mac. </li>
   <li> Or should we place it in this module? </li>
  </ul>

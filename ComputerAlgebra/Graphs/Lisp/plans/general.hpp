  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Graph concepts
  <ul>
   <li> A graph is just a 2-element list, consisting of the set of
   vertices, and a set of 2-element vertex sets. </li>

  \todo Generators.mac
  <ul>
   <li> Extend the documentation. </li>
   <li> Write documentation. </li>
   <li> Can we add comments to the graph-output? </li>

  \brief Plans regarding general tools for sequences occurring in Ramsey theory


  \todo deharmonise_eval_2
  <ul>
   <li> Write tests. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Transformations
  <ul>
   <li> DONE
   The functions transform_threshold_l, transform_steps_l and
   alphatau_l, alphastep2tau, tau2alphastep from
   ComputerAlgebra/RamseyTheory/Lisp/VanderWaerden/Numbers.mac should be moved
   here. </li>
   <li> The explanations need update (and a more general framework should be
   established). </li>
   <li> Compare
   Investigations/RamseyTheory/VanderWaerdenProblems/Transversals/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>

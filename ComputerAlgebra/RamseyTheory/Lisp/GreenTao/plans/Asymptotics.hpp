  \brief Plans regarding asymptotic estimations


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See
   Structures/NumberTheory/PrimeNumbers/plans/GrosswaldHagisFormula.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Estimating the factors in the infinite Grosswald-Hagis-product
  <ul>
   <li> An estimation for factor_C_gh_inf(k) is needed, so that for a given
   max_p it can be estimated, how large possibly the contribution of the
   remaining factors (with p > max_p) could be. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans regarding van der Waerden problems


  \todo Relations to other modules
  <ul>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/plans/Generators.hpp for
   the function ramsey_hg(q,r,n) and its variations. </li>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/plans/VanderWaerdenProblems.hpp
   for the SAT translation. </li>
   <li> See Experimentation/Investigations/plans/VanderWaerdenProblems.hpp for
   investigations. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Automorphisms of van-der-Waerden hypergraphs
  <ul>
   <li> We need to investigate experimentally the symmetries of these
   hypergraphs. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Automorphisms of van-der-Waerden clause-sets
  <ul>
   <li> The obvious automorphisms of diagonal van-der-Waerden clause-sets are
   given by the inner product of automorphisms for the underlying
   van-der-Waerden hypergraph and the S_m when using m parts. </li>
   <li> Are there more? </li>
  </ul>

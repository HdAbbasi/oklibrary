  \brief Plans regarding %Ramsey problems


  \todo Relations to other modules
  <ul>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/plans/Generators.hpp for
   the function ramsey_hg(q,r,n) and its variations. </li>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp
   for the SAT translation. </li>
   <li> See Experimentation/Investigations/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp for
   investigations. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Automorphisms of %Ramsey hypergraphs
  <ul>
   <li> First the natural operation of S_n on ramsey_hg(q,r,n) needs to
   be made available.
    <ol>
     <li> Implemented in
     ComputerAlgebra/RamseyTheory/Lisp/Ramsey/Hypergraphs.mac. </li>
     <li> Easiest first to consider the elements of S_n as lists. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The operation of S_n should be faithful (in most cases), and we
   need to extract the induced automorphisms of ramsey_hg(q,r,n). </li>
   <li> Then we need to find out whether these automorphisms cover all.
    <ol>
     <li> For small parameters values (including q=3,r=2) we can
     enumerate all automorphisms by brute force. </li>
     <li> What tools are available for hypergraph automorphisms?
      <ul>
       <li> See "Hypergraph automorphisms" in
       ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/plans/general.hpp for general plans.
       </li>
       <li> It seems that Gap doesn't provide any (direct) help here?
       At least grape only considers graphs --- are there other packages?
       </li>
       <li> What about nauty? See "Graph isomorphism" in
       Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/Graphs.hpp; but it
       seems that hypergraphs are not considered. </li>
       <li> Reducing the hypergraph isomorphism problem to (di)graph
       isomorphism can happen similar to the treatmeant of clause-sets (see
       ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Symmetries/Symmetries.mac). </li>
       <li> Considering just the 2-section of a hypergraph should in general
       be too rough (though it is attractive). </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> It would also be interesting here to try apply some of the symmetry 
   breaking ideas discussed in 
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp and
   then consider the number and character of the remaining symmetries. </li>  
  </ul>


  \todo Automorphisms of %Ramsey clause-sets
  <ul>
   <li> The obvious automorphisms of diagonal %Ramsey clause-sets are
   given by the inner product of automorphisms for the underlying %Ramsey
   hypergraph and the S_s when using s colours. </li>
   <li> So at least we have S_n x S_s (translated). </li>
   <li> Are there more?
    <ol>
     <li> It seems that by brute force (enumerating all clause-set
     automorphisms we cannot process any non-trivial example? </li>
     <li> We need stronger tools for computing automorphisms of clause-sets.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> And what about non-diagonal %Ramsey clause-sets? One would guess
   that in "most" cases there are no other automorphisms than given by
   the underlying S_n ? </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Tutorial Maxima/Lisp


  <h1> Tutorial for Maxima in the OKlibrary </h1>

  <ol>
   <li> To make use of the special OKlibrary Maxima functions, first they have to be loaded. One possibility is to load individual files seperately using:
   \verbatim
(%i1) oklib_load(filename)
   \endverbatim
   Alternatively, every function from the OKlibrary can be loaded
   simultaneously by using the oklib_load_all() function.
   \verbatim
(%i2) oklib_load_all()$
0 errors, 0 warnings
   \endverbatim
   </li> 
   <li> %Graphs
    <ol>
     <li> We provide graphs (directed and undirected, simple and general)
     in the direct mathematical definition. </li>
     <li> See the tutorial ComputerAlgebra/Graphs/Lisp/docus/Tutorial.hpp. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> %Satisfiability
    <ol>
     <li> Similarly, we provide clause-sets (boolean, and generalised)
      according to the mathematical definition. </li>
     <li> See the tutorial
      ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/docus/Tutorial.hpp. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>

  \brief Chapter "Colorings of graphs and Ramsey's theorem" from [A Course in %Combinatorics]


  <h1> Brook's theorem </h1>

  <h2> Greedy colouring </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> See "Greedy colouring" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/plans/Colouring.hpp. </li>
   <li> Greedy graph colouring will always find a colouring using at most
   d + 1 many colours, where d is the maxima degree. </li>
   <li> Likely it does not automatically yield a d-colouring if no component
   is an odd cycle or the graph does not contain a (d+1)-clique --- example?
   </li>
   <li> Can this be repaired? </li>
   <li> Or with other algorithms? Is it possible at all? </li>
  </ul>


  <h1> Ramsey's theorem </h1>


  <h2> On the automorphism group of %Ramsey hypergraphs </h2>

  <h2> Finding %Ramsey numbers via SAT </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Some experimentation has been started in this area at 
   Experimentation/Investigations/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp . </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> On the automorphism group of %Ramsey clause-sets </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Some initial discussions on the symmetries of the %Ramsey problems are
   at ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp . </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Tournaments and transitive tournaments </h2>


  <h1> The Lovasz local lemma </h1>

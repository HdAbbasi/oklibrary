  \brief Plans for the Data Encryption Standard crypto-system in Maxima/Lisp


  \todo Add todos


  \todo Find more test vectors
  <ul>
   <li> We need test vectors for reduced round variants of DES. </li>
   <li> Full 16 round DES swaps the two 32-bit outputs. Do reduced round
   DES variants do this? </li>
   <li> Authorative test vectors should answer this question. </li>
  </ul>

  
  \todo Links

   <li> For cryptanalysis functions for the DES see

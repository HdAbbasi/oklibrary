/*
   There are 3 main representations of the AES message and key blocks
   (which are treated in the same way).

TODO: "n_b = 4xn" ???

   The main representation is a n_b = 4xn matrix where the block size
   n_b is one of {128,164,192,224,256}, and this matrix corresponds
   exactly to the matrices as described in the AES standard.

TODO: And, what does this mean?

   The elements
   of the matrix are polynomials.

   Another representation is that of a list of polynomials which lists
   the elements of the AES block column by column.

   The final representation is that of a list of integers which lists
   the elements of the AES block column by column where each element is
   an integer representing the polynomials as used in the above
   representations, where the exact details of the correspondence are given in
   polybin2nat etc. in ByteField.mac.

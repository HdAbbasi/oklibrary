  \brief Plans for the cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard in Maxima/Lisp

  
  \todo Links
  <ul>
   <li> For the implementation of the DES see
   Lisp/CryptoSystems/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> See 
   Experimentation/Investigations/Cryptography/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Translating the constraint-system into SAT, CSP, ...
  <ul>
   <li> In Cryptanalysis/DataEncryptionStandard/ConstraintTranslation.mac
   we compute the "constraint system" corresponding to the DES-constraint.
   </li>
   <li> Now translations into SAT, CSP etc. are needed. </li>
  </ul>

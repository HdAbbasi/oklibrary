  \brief Plans for the cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard in Maxima/Lisp


  \todo Improve tests
  <ul>
   <li> The tests "okltest_des_sbox_fulldnf_cl" and 
   "okltest_des_sbox_fullcnf_fcs" only test Sboxes 1 and 5. </li>
   <li> The tests should cover all Sboxes! </li>
   <li> The tests should also test properties of the Sboxes. 
   See "Analysing the S-boxes" in
   Experimentation/Investigations/Cryptography/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/Sboxes/general.hpp .
   </li>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Create constraint evaluation system
  <ul>
   <li> We wish to provide tests for functions such as "des_round_xor".
   To do this, we must evaluate the generated constraints. </li>
   <li> We need a constraint evaluation system. </li>
   <li> This system should:
   <ul>
    <li> Take a list of constraints. </li>
    <li> Take an assignment to all "input varables". The "input variables"
    should be enough to determine all others. </li>
    <li> Evaluate each constraint using an associated evaluation function.
    For example functions in 
    ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/CryptoSystems/DataEncryptionStandard/Cipher.mac.
    </li>
    <li> Propagate the inferred variables for each constraint to all others.
    </li>
    <li> Return the assignment to the variables after all propagations. </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>

  
  \todo Links
  <ul>
   <li> For the implementation of the DES see
   Lisp/CryptoSystems/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> See 
   Experimentation/Investigations/Cryptography/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Translating the constraint-system into SAT, CSP, ...
  <ul>
   <li> In Cryptanalysis/DataEncryptionStandard/ConstraintTranslation.mac
   we compute the "constraint system" corresponding to the DES-constraint.
   </li>
   <li> Now translations into SAT, CSP etc. are needed. </li>
  </ul>

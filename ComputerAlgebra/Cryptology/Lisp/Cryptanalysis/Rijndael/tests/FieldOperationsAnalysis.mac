  \brief Tests for the analysis functions of the AES Field Operations

Use by

oklib_load("Transitional/ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/tests/FieldOperationsAnalysis.mac");
        
  \bug DONE Tests take too much time for level basic.
  <ul>
   <li> It seems this can be avoided, since oklib_test_level is yet
   not queried in the tests. </li>
   <li> ok_test_level introduced, although no tests will be possible at
   oklib_test_level = 0, due to the time the function to be tested takes. </li>
  </ul>

  \bug (DONE Tests now need expanding)
  Test functions only take ONE argument.
  <ul>
   <li> The above functions is only a HELPER function. </li>
  </ul>

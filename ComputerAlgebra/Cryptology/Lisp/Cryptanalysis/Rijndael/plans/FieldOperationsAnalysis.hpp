  \brief Plans for the Cryptanalysis of the Rijndael field operations in Maxima/Lisp

  
  \todo Provide tests for all functions
  
  
  \todo Generate good CNF hitting clause-sets for the AES Sbox
  
  
  \todo Extracting prime implicate representations from the hitting-cls-representations
  
  
  \todo Compute *all* prime implicates (for the purpose of analysis):
  
 
  \todo Find the symmetries of the AES Sbox DNF

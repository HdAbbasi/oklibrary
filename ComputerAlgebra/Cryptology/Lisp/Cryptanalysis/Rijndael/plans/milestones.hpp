  \module_version Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael 0.0.4 (7.3.2008)


  \par Version 0.0.5
  
  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/SboxAnalysis.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Provide tests for all functions
    - Move functions which do not belong to this module DONE
    - Replace append_all with uaapply DONE

  \par
  In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/SboxAnalysis.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Sbox CNF and DNF generation functions DONE


  \par Version 0.0.6

  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Review and tidy todos
    - Create / update milestones

  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/Translations.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Write tests for all functions
    - Write Docus

  \par Version 0.0.7
  
  \par
  In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/SboxAnalysis.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Generate good CNF hitting clause-sets for the AES Sbox
    - Extracting prime implicate representations from the hitting-cls-representations


  \par Version 0.1
  
  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/Translations.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Constraint Rewrite System
    - Encoding AES (top down)

  \par
   The aim is to have a first translation, so that amongst others SAT-solvers
   can be utilised to attack AES.

  \par
   Update the following milestones.


  \par Version 0.1.1

  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Discussion on Generalisation/Parameterisation


  \par Version 0.1.2
  
  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/Translations.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Active clauses for field operations
    - Partitioning into active clauses
    - Algebraic aspects DONE (Moved to CryptoSystems/Rijndael)
  
  \par
   Update the following milestones.

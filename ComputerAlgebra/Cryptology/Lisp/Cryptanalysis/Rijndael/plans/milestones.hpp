  \module_version Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael 0.0.4 (7.3.2008)


  \par Version 0.0.5

  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Review and tidy todos
    - Create / update milestones

  \par Version 0.0.6
  
  \par
  In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Generate "good" CNF hitting clause-sets for the AES Sbox
    - Sbox CNF and DNF generation functions DONE

  \par Version 0.1
  
  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Encoding AES (top down)

  \par
   The aim is to have a first translation, so that amongst others SAT-solvers
   can be utilised to attack AES.

  \par
   Update the following milestones.

  \par Version 0.1.2
  
  \par
   In ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Algebraic aspects
    - Active clauses for field operations
    - Partitioning into active clauses
  
  \par
   Update the following milestones.

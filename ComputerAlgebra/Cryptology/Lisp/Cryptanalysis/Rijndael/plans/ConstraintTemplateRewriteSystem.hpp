  \brief Plans for the development of constraint template rewrite systems.


  \todo Placement
  <ul>
   <li> Should this constraint template translation system be moved
   elsewhere in the library? </li>
   <li> The constraint template rewrite functions and their tests
   are not specific to the AES. </li>
  </ul>

  
  \todo Move appropriate todos here


  \todo DONE Standardise names for constraint template rewrite system
  <ul>
   <li> Currently the names within the rewrite system use the term
   "constraint" or "cst" and are far from consistent. </li>
   <li> The system should use the term "cst" for "ConStraint Template"
   as a prefix for all the functions. </li>
  </ul>

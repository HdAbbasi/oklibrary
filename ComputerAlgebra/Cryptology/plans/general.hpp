  \brief Plans for cryptological tools realised in the computer algebra system


  \todo Restructuring
  <ul>
   <li> We should have sub-modules "Cryptanalysis" and "CryptoSystems" (say),
   which contain attacks resp. different implementations. </li>
   <li> Likely this goes (first) to the Lisp-submodules. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo See Applications/Cryptanalysis/plans/general.hpp
  <ul>
   <li> Provide links. </li>
   <li> Update milestones. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Write "oklib --sage" : DONE (moved to
  Buildsystem/MasterScript/plans/general.hpp)
  <ul>
   <ul> This should be moved to sonewhere else. </li>
   <li> Automatise loading, compiling etc. </li>

  \brief Plans for cryptological tools realised in the computer algebra system


  \todo Restructuring
  <ul>
   <li> Link to module Structures/Cryptology (see
   Structures/Cryptology/plans/general.hpp). </li>
   <li> DONE We should have sub-modules "Cryptanalysis" and "CryptoSystems" (say),
   which contain attacks resp. different implementations. </li>
   <li> DONE Likely this goes (first) to the Lisp-submodules. </li>
   <li> DONE All the plans in this file should move to appropriate
   sub-modules of the Lisp-modules. </li>
   <li> DONE (moved to ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/plans/Rijndael.hpp)
   Some todos need to be reworked:
    <ol>
     <li> "Maxima: implementation issues" and "Maxima: design" needs
     unification/splitting. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Create sub-modules for "Lisp" and "Aldor". DONE </li>
   <li> DONE (yes, only Maxima and Axiom (at this time))
   Likely "Sage" is not treated on its own. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo See Applications/Cryptanalysis/plans/general.hpp
  <ul>
   <li> Provide links. </li>
   <li> Update milestones. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Write a general docus-file

  \par Version history

   - 0.0.3 : 25.7.2007; initial version number (several plans, starting prototyping).
   - 0.0.4 : 7.9.2007; made plans more concrete, and explored the landscape; a first Sage-implementation exists, from which now the Maxima implementation is to be designed.
   - 0.0.5 : 19.2.2008; Rijndael docus started; Sage implementation abandoned. Maxima implementation started. From here more work needs to be done on the plans and docus.

  \brief Plans on linear algebra in Maxima


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Write docus


  \todo Indices
  <ul>
   <li> Also hermitian_rank_eig and hermitian_rank_charpoly should
   be changed to compute the indices as pnn_indices. </li>
   <li> So that we get pnn_indices_eig and pnn_indices_charpoly. </li>
   <li> Perhaps then we create a generic function for computing the
   hermitian rank from a version of pnn_indices. </li>
   <li> And we should have a function for computing the characteristic
   polynomial of a clause-set (then hermitian_rank_charpoly would use
   this function). </li>
  </ul>

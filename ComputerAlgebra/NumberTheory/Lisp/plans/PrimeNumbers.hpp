  \brief Plans regarding prime numbers


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See Experimentation/Investigations/plans/AdditiveNumberTheory.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/Generators.mac. </li>

  \todo Enumerating prime numbers
  <ul>
   <li> We should ask whether Maxima plans some support for the functions
   we are considering. </li>
   <li> In the e-mail we should give a link to the web page with
   ComputerAlgebra/NumberTheory/Lisp/PrimeNumbers.mac. </li>

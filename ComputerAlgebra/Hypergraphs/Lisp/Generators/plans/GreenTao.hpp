  \brief Plans regarding generators for Green-Tao hypergraphs


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See Combinatorics/Hypergraphs/Generators/plans/GreenTao.hpp
   and OKlib/Combinatorics/Hypergraphs/Generators/GreenTao.hpp,
   OKlib/Combinatorics/Hypergraphs/Generators/GreenTao.cpp for
   C++ generators. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Further information on arithmetic progressions in prime numbers
  <ul>
   <li> It seems that statistics on the number of hyperedges in
   arithprog_primes_ohg are of interest (and non-trivial); see
   Experimentation/Investigations/RamseyTheory/GreenTaoProblems/plans/AdditiveNumberTheory.hpp
   . </li>
   <li> The basic fact for arithprog_primes_finish, namely that for an
   arithmetic progression P of length k of primes with start a and slope d
   we must have a >= k, and if a <> k then product_primes(k) divides d,
   must be documented. </li>
  </ul>

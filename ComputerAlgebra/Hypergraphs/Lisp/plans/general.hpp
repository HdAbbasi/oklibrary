  \brief Plans for Maxima-components for hypergraphs


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Write docus
  <ul>
   <li> We should have a list of all available functions. </li>
   <li> Seems that this list needs to be maintained manually? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Hypergraph transversals

   <li> See Hypergraphs/Transversals/plans/DirectTransversalEnumeration.hpp. </li>
   <li> See "Rewrite hypergraph transversal functions in Maxima" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Mupad/plans/general.hpp. </li>

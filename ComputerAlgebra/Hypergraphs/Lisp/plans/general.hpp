  \brief Plans for Maxima-components for hypergraphs


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Write docus
  <ul>
   <li> We should have a list of all available functions. </li>
   <li> Seems that this list needs to be maintained manually? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Hypergraphs/Lisp/Generators.mac
  <ul>
   <li> Create complete r-graphs. </li>
   <li> Create Sudoko-hypergraphs (such that the Sudoko-problems can be
   expressed as strong colouring problems).
    <ol>
     <li> For box dimension p the vertex set should be {1,...,p}^2. </li>
     <li> The 3N hyperedges (N=p^2) just correspond to the rows, columns
     and boxes (the hypergraph is thus N-uniform). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Create Ramsey graphs etc. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for the (deprecated) Mupad-module
  \deprecated To be replaced by an open-source system.


  \todo Rewriting:
  After a new computer-algebra system has been chosen (see "Computer algebra system"
  in Transitional/plans/general.hpp), all modules need to be redesigned
  and reimplemented:
  <ol>
   <li> Mupad/Design.mup : Just the incidence matrix of the Fano plane. </li>
   <li> Mupad/Hilfsfunktionen.mup : Various general functions </li>
   <li> Mupad/Orthogonal.mup : Conflict combinatorics </li>
   <li> Mupad/SATCounting.mup : Precise calculations of satisfiability
   probabilities in the standard random-formula model (constant density) </li>
   <li> Mupad/TestenFormelGenAES.mup : Testing the random clause-set
   generator </li>
   <li> Mupad/VanderWaerden.mup : Computing optimal resolution trees etc.
   for van der Waerden-clause-sets </li>
   <li> Mupad/tau.mup : See ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/TauMachinery/plans/general.hpp. DONE (moved elsewhere) </li>
  </ol>

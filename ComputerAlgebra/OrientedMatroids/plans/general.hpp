  \brief General plans regarding oriented matroids


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/plans/Matroids/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo External sources
  <ul>
   <li> We need to find open-source systems which handle oriented matroids.
   </li>
   <li> See "Polyeders, matroids etc." in
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/ComputerAlgebra.hpp. </li>
   <li> [Bokowski, Computational Oriented Matroids] should be useful
   (though it is weak on notions --- which seems to be true for the whole
   oriented-matroid community). </li>
  </ul>

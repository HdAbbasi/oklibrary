  \par
   Update the following milestones.


  \par Version 0.0.10

  \par
   In Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/RamseyTheory/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp
   the following topics are handled:
    - Extend %Ramsey symmetry breaking generators to generate Extended Dimacs

  \par Version 0.0.11

  \par
   In Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/RamseyTheory/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp
   the following topics are handled:
    - Relations to other modules
    - Symmetry breaking by using symmetries of the solution space

   \par Version 0.1
   We have rudimentary documentation for all generators, and for %Ramsey
   problems we have translations available for all (standard) forms,
   including some initial symmetry-breaking encodings. And the basic
   methodology for writing generators is in place.
   

  \par Version 0.1.1

  \par Version history

   - 0.0.8 : 22.8.2009; initial version, several basic generators available (van-der-Waerden-, Green-Tao-, Hindman-, and Ramsey-problems), and plans for further extensions.

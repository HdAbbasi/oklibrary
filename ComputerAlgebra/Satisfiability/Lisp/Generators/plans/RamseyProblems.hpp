  \brief Plans for Maxima-generators for Ramsey-problems


  \todo Ramsey problems
  <ul>
   <li> One needs to think about the extreme cases; it seems there are
   inconsistencies.
    <ol>
     <li> Compare "Ramsey graphs" in
     ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/plans/Generators.hpp. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> For larger Ramsey problems, we need the ability to compute directly
   the standardised clause-set (which is just the hypergraph edges in two
   versions, positive (as they are) and negative). </li>
   <li> Compare "Colouring problems" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>

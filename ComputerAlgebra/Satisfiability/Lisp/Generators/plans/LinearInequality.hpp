  \brief Plans for Maxima-generators (of SAT-problems) related to linear inequalities


  \todo Docus


  \todo Add adder circuit translation
  <ul>
   <li> Also provide the translation centred around the Tseitin translation of
   the boolean adder circuits, for comparison. </li>
   <li> See Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/plans/LinInequal.hpp for 
   a C++ implementation. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Add statistics functions

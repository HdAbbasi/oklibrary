  \brief Plans for generators for (various types of) random clause-sets


  \todo Random subsets, sublists etc.
  <ul>
   <li> In
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/MinimalUnsatisfiability/InverseSingularDP.mac
   we have "random_sublist". </li>
   <li> And in ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/RandomClauseSets.mac
   we have "random_sublist_l". </li>
   <li> Likely these functions should go to ComputerAlgebra/DataStructures.
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  \todo Random generator
  <ul>
   <li> Using our maxima-aes-implementation, implement the random generator
   as in Experimentation/RandomGenerator/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>

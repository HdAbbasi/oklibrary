  \brief Plans for Maxima-generators related to Hindman problems (and generalisations)


  \todo Improve generator names
  <ul>
   <li> The current names are rather unsystematic. </li>
   <li> Also the notion of "degeneration" needs to be replaced by "injective"
   (appropriately). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Write tests

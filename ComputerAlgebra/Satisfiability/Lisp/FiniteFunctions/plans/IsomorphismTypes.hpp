  \brief Plans regarding isomorphism types of boolean functions (and generalisations)


  \todo The notion of isomorphism


  \todo Enumerating isomorphism types
  <ul>
   <li> The article of [Alasdair Urquhart, Enumerating types of boolean
   functions, The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, 2009, 15(3):273-299] is the
   starting point. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Considering special boolean functions
  <ul>
   <li> Permutations (see
   Experimentation/Investigations/BooleanFunctions/plans/Permutations.hpp)
   are of interest: can the general method be refined to yield the enumeration
   of all isomorphism types of permutations (as boolean functions)? </li>
  </ul>

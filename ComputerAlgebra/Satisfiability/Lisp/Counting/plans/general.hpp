  \brief General plans for counting satisfying assignments


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Write the direct algorithm (running through all total assignments)


  \todo Write a scheme which uses r_k-splitting trees


  \todo okltest_satprob_mcind
  <ul>
   <li> This test-function should be a general test function for the counting
   of satisfiying assignments of boolean clause-sets. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo satprob_mcind
  <ul>
   <li> See "Conflicts.mac" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/ClauseSets/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Connect to the counting-module in part Satisfiability.

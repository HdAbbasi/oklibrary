  \brief General plans for counting satisfying assignments


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Write the direct algorithm (running through all total assignments)
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps in "Counting/Basics.mac". </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Write a scheme which uses r_k-splitting trees


  \todo okltest_satprob
  <ul>
   <li> We should perhaps create Counting/tests/Basics.mac, and move this
   general testfunction there. </li>
   <li> DONE
   This test-function should be a general test function for the counting
   of satisfiying assignments of boolean clause-sets. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo satprob_mcind
  <ul>
   <li> See "Conflicts.mac" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/ClauseSets/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> Given an upper bound on the independence number, compute the hypergraph
   of independent subsets more directly. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo satprob_incexl_hitting
  <ul>
   <li> Similar to satprob_mcind, compute approximations. </li>
   <li> One would assume, that this computation is always less efficient
   than satprob_mcind? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Connect to the counting-module in part Satisfiability.


  \todo Sum-product (belief propagation) and beyond
  <ul>
   <li> Implement the sum-product algorithm (see also
   Satisfiability/Algorithms/SumProduct/plans/general.hpp). </li>
   <li> Implement the "Iterative Join-Graph Propagation" IJGP, especially
   in the form "IJGP(i)-SC" from [Kask, Dechter, Gogate; Counting-Based
   Look-Ahead Schemes for Constraint Satisfaction; CP 2004]. </li>
   <li> Comparing tw(vig(F)) (the treewidth of the variable-interaction
   graph) with alpha(cg(F)) (the independence number of the conflict graph)
   is here of interest. </li>
  </ul>

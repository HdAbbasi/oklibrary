  \brief Plans for Maxima-components related to conflict-patterns of clause-sets


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Write docus


  \todo Relations to other modules
  <ul>
   <li> See Experimentation/Investigations/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo mcind_cs, cind_cs:
  <ul>
   <li> DONE The naming should reflect the special method used (here using
   transversals). </li>
   <li> Likely the best is just to refer to all possible ways of
   computing maximal independent sets of a hypergraph (or, of a graph;
   likely one can take advantage of this more special situation). </li>
   <li> It seems not to be worth to develop an algorithm which computes
   directly all indepedent sets? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo %Generators for unsatisfiable uniform and variable-regular hitting
  clause-sets
  <ul>
   <li> There is the important question for what k,r,n we have
   F with uuhittingcsp(F) which are k-uniform and r-variable-regular.
    <ol>
     <li> sasg2000 is an example for k=3,r=6,n=4. </li>
     <li> Ignoring r (i.e., admitting an arbitrary r) we arrive exactly at
     the notion of an "associative block design" (ABD). </li>
     <li> We are allowed to do so since r = 2^k * k / n. </li>
     <li> Apparently ABD's are denoted as "ABD(n,k)"). </li>
     <li> The problem in [Savicky, Sgall, 2000, DNF tautologies with a limited
     number of occurrences of every variable] is, as stated about arbitrary
     uniform unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets and how low a maximal
     variable-degree can be achieved. However their examples achieve actually
     variable-regularity (and also literal-regularity); so we can pose a
     hierarchy of questions for bounds on the maximal variable- and
     literal-degree (how low is possible):
      <ol>
       <li> For arbitrary k-uniform clause-sets: This should be the
       Tovey-problem studied in [Hoory, Szeider, 2006], and apparently
       these considerations belong to another module (where those
       constructions should be implemented). </li>
       <li> Considering only hitting clause-sets; this is the subject of this
       module. </li>
       <li> And then we have the requirements of variable-regularity (ABD's),
       and literal-regularity. </li>
       <li> By Theorem 9.7 in [Lint, Wilson, a Course in %Combinatorics, 2nd ed.]
       actually variable-regularity here already implies literal-regularity.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> In order to improve the bound from [Savicky, Sgall] we do not
     require variable-regularity, but if we do so, then we are asking for
     k, n with log_k(n) > log_3(4). </li>
     <li> An ABD(8,5) exists which improves the bound. </li>
     <li> To establish s_k = Theta(2^k / k) for the function s_k introduced
     by [Kratochvil, Savicky, Tuza, 1993] for the Tovey-problem, which is best
     possible, we needed to find an example with n = k^2. </li>
     <li> This seems very demanding --- perhaps it is essential to give
     up variable-regularity and hittingness for s_k. But we need to search the
     literature! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Constructions:
    <ol>
     <li> The construction from Lemma 3 in [Savicky, Sgall, 2000], which from
     uniform unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets F,F' of rank k,k' construct a
     uniform unsatisfiable hitting clause-set of rank k * k'. </li>
     <li> This construction should be the same as in [Lint, Wilson], Lemma 9.9,
     and thus should transfer variable-uniformity. </li>
     <li> There are two other constructions in [Lint, Wilson], Theorem 9.10, and
     Theorem 9.11, which need to be implemented. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Sporadic cases:
    <ol>
     <li> We have already sasg2000, an ABD(4,3). </li>
     <li> Perhaps we can determine all ABD(4,3)'s. </li>
     <li> Another sporadic case is ABD(8,5). </li>
     <li> Again, the question to get "all". </li>
     <li> Are there more sporadic examples? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Sequences
    <ol>
     <li> The general constructions, applied to the sporadic examples, yield
     sequences, for which at least for the "prominent cases" we should provide
     convenience functions. </li>
     <li> So Theorem 4 in [Savicky, Sgall] applies the product-construction to
     sasg2000. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo %Generators for unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets
  <ul>
   <li> The above is concerned with unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets which
   are uniform and variable-regular (and thus literal-regular). </li>
   <li> If on the other hand we drop (variable-)regularity (so we are only
   considering unsatisfiable uniform hitting clause-sets), what constructions
   are then available?
    <ol>
     <li> We can inspect the ABD-constructions, and see to what degree they are
     generic, i.e., for assumptions are actually needed and which are
     transferred to the result. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> And what about general unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets?
    <ol>
     <li> One could also consider regularity (variable- or literal-regularity)
     with uniformity. </li>
     <li> In any case, the ABD-constructions need to be inspected. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Searching for ABD(n,k) (via SAT)
  <ul>
   <li> Most natural seems the clause-based approach:
    <ol>
     <li> For each of the 2^k clauses we have a variable, with domain
     all binom(n,k) * 2^k clauses. </li>
     <li> We have one injectivity condition over all variables (an active
     clause). </li>
     <li> We have one condition stating that all assigned clauses clash
     pairwise.
      <ul>
       <li> Unclear whether this yields an active clause. </li>
       <li> The underlying general problem is for a hitting clause-set to find
       a satisfying partial assignment of minimal size --- unclear whether this
       can be done in polynomial time. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> And for each variable we have the condition that it occurs in
     exactly 2^k * k / n clauses; this should yield (n) active clauses. </li>
     <li> Stronger, instead just requiring variable-regularity, we should
     better require literal-regularity. And there are other conditions as well.
     </li>
     <li> Finally, symmetry-breaking can be established by choosing a linear
     order on all clauses (for example lexicographical) and also order the
     variables, and by demanding that the first variable gets the smallest
     clause and that the order is variable-values is strictly ascending.
     Are there suitable orderings, so that this becomes an active clause??
     Perhaps we shouldn't demand strict ascending, since this is already
     covered by the injectivity constraint. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Apparently the smallest open case is to find an ABD(12,6) (or to
   determine that it doesn't exist). An easier test case should be ABD(8,5)
   (here there are solutions; perhaps we can determine them all?). </li>
   <li> Regarding the quality-measure mu(n,k) = log_k(n) (the more the better)
   we have mu(4,3) < mu(8,5) < mu(12,6). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Rules for ABD(n,k)
  <ul>
   <li> Implement <code>abd_exists(n,k)</code> which returns "true", "false" or
   "unknown". </li>
   <li> For that we should use Maxima's ability to use rules. </li>
  </ul>

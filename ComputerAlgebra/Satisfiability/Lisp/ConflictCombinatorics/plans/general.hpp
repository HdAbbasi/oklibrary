  \brief Plans for Maxima-components related to conflict-patterns of clause-sets


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Write docus


  \todo mcind_cs, cind_cs:
  <ul>
   <li> DONE The naming should reflect the special method used (here using
   traversals). </li>
   <li> Likely the best is just to refer to all possible ways of
   computing maximal independent sets of a hypergraph (or, of a graph;
   likely one can take advantage of this more special situation). </li>
   <li> It seems not to be worth to develop an algorithm which computes
   directly all indepedent sets? </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans related to hitting clause-sets


  \todo Constructions
  <ul>
   <li> The set of hitting clause-sets is a sub-monoid (with zero) of
   CLS with "or_cs" (see
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/ClauseSets/plans/Constructions.hpp).
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Decomposing clause-sets into hitting clause-sets
  <ul>
   <li> DONE
   Write a function which actually computes the conflict-partition-number
   of a clause-set (the smallest number of hitting sub-clause-sets which
   partition the clause-set). </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for Maxima-components regarding SAT-reductions


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write docus


  \todo Strengthen the tests
  <ul>
   <li> We need more systematic coverage (with small clause-sets). </li>
   <li> We should also employ some form of data-tables so that the tests
   mainly run through these tables. </li>
   <li> And we should strengthen re-use of sub-tests between the various (rather
   similar) test-functions. </li>
  </ul>

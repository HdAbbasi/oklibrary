  \brief Plans for Maxima-components regarding computation of prime implicates/implicants of boolean functions and clause-sets
  
  
  \todo min_2resolution_closure_cs
  <ul>
   <li> Currently the name likely is not corrected, since if the input is not
   a full clause-set, then likely we do not compute the min-closure under
   2-subsumption resolution (example?). </li>
  </ul>

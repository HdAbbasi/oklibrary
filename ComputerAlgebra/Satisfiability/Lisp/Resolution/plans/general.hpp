  \brief Plans for Maxima-components regarding the resolution calculus


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Write docus


  \todo See ProofSystems/Resolution/plans/Search.hpp.


  \todo DP
  <ul>
   <li> The current implementation of opt_min_dp can be improved if only
   the minimum or the maximum is sought. </li>
   <li> DONE (there is only the technical problem that apparently local hash
   arrays are not recognised by "arrayinfo" and "listarray" ? We should
   ask about this at the maxima-mailing-list)
   To make the current implementation worthwhile, perhaps it should
   show the full distribution of sizes, using a map (size -> count). </li>
   <li> DONE The output of distribution_min_dp should be further processed,
   so that easily all information is available.
   <ol>
    <li> Perhaps we just sort the ocurring sizes together with their
    counts, and then output a list of pairs [size, count], sorted
    by size (ascending). </li>
    <li> It seems actually, that "arrayinfo" already returns a sorted list,
    so that nothing needs to be done. </li>
   </ol>
   </li>
   <li> We need also the greedy heuristics, which chooses the DP-variable
   such that the number of clauses for the next level is minimised. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo resolution_closure_cs
  <ul>
   <li> The implementation is very similar to min_resolution_closure_cs:
   Should we construct a common generalisation? </li>
   <li> DONE Same regarding monitoring as min_resolution_closure_cs. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo min_2resolution_closure_cs
  <ul>
   <li> Currently the name likely is not corrected, since if the input is not
   a full clause-set, then likely we do not compute the min-closure under
   2-subsumption resolution (example?). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Resolution proofs
  <ul>
   <li> The natural format for a resolution proof is a non-empty list,
   where each entry is either a clause (an "axiom") or a pair consisting
   of a clause (the "resolvent") and a pair of (smaller) indices (the
   indices of the "parent clauses"). </li>
   <li> We need a correctness-checker. </li>
   <li> We should also investigate the existing file-formats for resolution
   proofs, and we should provide input- and output-facilities. </li>
   <li> This linear format is in 1-1 correspondence to the representation
   via labelled dag's; we need a representation of labelled graphs,
   digraphs and labelled digraphs. </li>
   <li> The above can easily be generalised to non-boolean clause-sets.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Bounded resolution
  <ul>
   <li> Implement the different forms of bounded resolution. </li>
   <li> In this way we can determine the width of a clause-set. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Read-once resolution proofs
  <ul>
   <li> Write a checker whether a resolution proof is read-once. </li>
   <li> Implement the translation of "has read-once refutation" into SAT. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo min_resolution_closure_cs : DONE
  <ul>
   <li> DONE As in "Maxima"-"Monitoring" in ComputerAlgebra/plans/general.hpp,
   perhaps the monitoring-output should be standardised, containing the name
   of the function? </li>
   <li> A second output is needed, with the list of c(F_i)
   for the successive stages. DONE </li>
   <li> In monitoring mode these numbers are output once a round is
   completed (compare "Maxima"-"Monitoring" in
   ComputerAlgebra/plans/general.hpp). DONE </li>
  </ul>

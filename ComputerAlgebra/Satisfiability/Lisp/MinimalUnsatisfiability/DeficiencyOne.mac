/* A "full tree representation" of F in MU(1) is a read-once
   resolution tree where every variable of F is resolved
   in the whole tree exactly once.
   For a "tree representation" the clause-labels are removed,
   and only the resolution variables (at inner nodes) and the
   clause-labels at the leaves are kept, that is, we have a
   binary tree labelled with literals at inner nodes, and with
   clauses at leaves.
   For tree representations of F in SMU(1) one doesn't need the clauses 
   at the leaves, and so splitting trees, where all leaves are labelled by 
   "false" and where the variable-labels are unique, are to be used then.

  \brief Operations regarding the maximal variable degree of (typicall uniform) minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets

  For a fixed clause-length k, the minimum of the max-var-degree is sought.
  For the extremal clause-sets this means that the max-var-degree must be
  as small as possible.

oklib_load("OKlib/ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/MinimalUnsatisfiability/MaxVarDegrees.mac");

/* Formal boolean clause-set with 10 variables and 13 clauses, such that
   the variable-degree is 4, and every satisfying assignment for variable 1
   must set it to false. */

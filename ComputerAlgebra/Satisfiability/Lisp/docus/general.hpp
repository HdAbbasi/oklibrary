  \brief User documentation for SAT in Lisp/Maxima


  <h2> General ideas </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Boolean clause-sets are treated directly, very similar to the
   mathematical definition. </li>
   <li> The point is not efficient computation, but
    <ol>
     <li> readability of code </li>
     <li> ease of writing code. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The aim is to create a <strong>comprehensive</strong> collection of
   simple "procedural specifications". </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> General documentation </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> See the Tutorial
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/docus/Tutorial.hpp (by MH). </li>

  \brief Plans for SAT algorithms related propagation algorithms like belief and survey propagation


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See Satisfiability/Algorithms/SumProduct/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Implement WP (warning propagation)
  <ul>
   <li> For boolean clause-sets the algorithm is described in [Braunstein,
   Mezard, Zecchina, 2005, Survey Propagation: An Algorithm for
   Satisfiability]. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Implement BP (belief propagation)
  <ul>
   <li> Also known as "sum-product algorithm". </li>
   <li> For boolean clause-sets the algorithm is described in [Braunstein,
   Mezard, Zecchina, 2005, Survey Propagation: An Algorithm for
   Satisfiability]. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Implement SP (survey propgation)
  <ul>
   <li> For boolean clause-sets the algorithm is described in [Braunstein,
   Mezard, Zecchina, 2005, Survey Propagation: An Algorithm for
   Satisfiability]. </li>
  </ul>

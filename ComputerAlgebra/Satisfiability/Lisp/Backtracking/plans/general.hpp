  \brief Plans for Maxima-components regarding backtracking algorithms


  \todo Create milestones


  \todo Write tests


  \todo Write docus


  \todo "Theoretical algorithms"
  <ul>
   <li> All algorithms from the realm of worst-case upper bounds
   on SAT (and, finally, also for all other areas), should be
   implemented. </li>
   <li> Randomised as well as deterministic algorithms. </li>
   <li> And also the (typically very simple) algorithms from probabilistic
   analysis of SAT (and other areas). </li>
   <li> All these algorithms should be spread out over the modules to
   which their algorithms fit best? </li>
  </ul>

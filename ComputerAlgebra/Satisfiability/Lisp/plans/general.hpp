  \brief Plans for Lisp-SAT in general


  \todo Redesign
  <ul>
   <li> First we consider the simple Lisp-level. </li>
   <li> So all existing computer-algebra-SAT-components are moved
   to Satisfiability/Lisp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Relations to other modules
  <ul>
   <li> What is the relation to LogicalReflection/plans/FundamentalADTs.hpp? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update plans:
  <ul>
   <li> Satisfiability/Lisp/plans/Clauses.hpp </li>
   <li> Satisfiability/Lisp/plans/Literals.hpp </li>
   <li> Satisfiability/Lisp/plans/MinimalSatisfyingAssignments.hpp </li>
   <li> Satisfiability/Lisp/plans/SatisfactionProblems.hpp </li>
  </ul>

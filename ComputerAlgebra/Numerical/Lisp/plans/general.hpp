  \brief Plans for numerical Maxima/Lisp functions in general


  \todo Function "min_scanning" 
  (ComputerAlgebra/Numerical/Lisp/Minimisation.mac)
  <ul>
   <li> Is it avoidable that argument-names like "f8765" are capured by
   function definitions (so that in the presence of a functiion with
   name f8765 min_scanning is not working)?? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Implement the "downhill simplex method in multidimensions"
  (according to Nelder and Mead).

  \brief General plans regarding "traditional" combinatorics, counting and
  enumeration


  \todo Module outline : DONE
  <ul>
   <li> What other modules should be included? </li>
   <li> Since here only "traditional combinatorics" is handled, of course
   "hypergraphs" are not included, but also not "graphs". </li>
   <li> This is different from the part OKlib/Combinatorics, which includes
   all possible forms of combinatorics. </li>
   <li> Besides enumeration, what then do we find here? Counting. </li>
   <li> So besides module Enumeration we shall have module Counting, for
   counting-mathematics (e.g., partitions). </li>
  </ul>

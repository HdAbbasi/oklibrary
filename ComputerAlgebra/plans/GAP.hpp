  \brief General plans regarding the computer algebra system Gap (and SAT)


  \todo General impression
  <ul>
   <li> The system seems to work very well, it seems very powerful,
   and has definitely many functions which are very useful for us. </li>
   <li> Perhaps the programming language is kind of a special-purpose
   language, supporting efficient implementations in the domain of
   algebra, but perhaps a bit specialised:
    <ol>
     <li> It seems that there are no lambda-terms? </li>
     <li> And also no other mechanisms to support some form of
     polymorphism? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The central question is how GAP fits into our system. </li>
  </ul>

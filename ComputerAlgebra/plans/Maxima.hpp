  \brief General plans regarding the Maxima computer algebra system

  For discussions (explanations, documentations) of Maxima-functionality see
  ComputerAlgebra/plans/MaximaTechniques.hpp.


  \bug DONE (now setting the memory-limits when loading Maxima; resetting them
  from the command-line is okay with Ecl, but setting them when loading a
  file is asking for too much)
  Maxima seg-faults when loading a file setting memory-limits
  <ul>
   <li> When running at test_level=full, we get
   \verbatim
okltest_certificates_vdw_3k(certificates_vdw_3k)
/bin/bash: line 6: 28062 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) HOME=/home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/Installations/Maxima/ecl/5.23.2 /home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/Installations/Maxima/ecl/5.23.2/bin/rmaxima --batch-string="" --very-quiet
make[2]: *** [/home/kullmann/OKplatform/OKsystem/OKlib/ComputerAlgebra/RamseyTheory/Lisp/VanderWaerden/testobjects/certificates.mac] Error 1
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> Same with 5.21.1 and 5.23.2. </li>
   <li> The same happens when just running
   \verbatim
oklib_test_level:1;
oklib_load("OKlib/ComputerAlgebra/RamseyTheory/Lisp/VanderWaerden/testobjects/certificates.mac");
   \endverbatim
   from the Maxima-shell. </li>
   <li> However
   \verbatim
oklib_test_level:1;
load(sconcat(OKsystem,"/OKlib/ComputerAlgebra/RamseyTheory/Lisp/VanderWaerden/testobjects/certificates.mac"));
   \endverbatim
   works?! </li>
   <li> On the other hand,
   \verbatim
oklib_test_level:1;
batch(sconcat(OKsystem,"/OKlib/ComputerAlgebra/RamseyTheory/Lisp/VanderWaerden/testobjects/certificates.mac"));
   \endverbatim
   fails again with a segmentation fault. </li>
   <li> Notify the Maxima mailing-list. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Why is Maxima file output so slow?
  <ul>
   <li> We have the following very slow output in Maxima:
   \verbatim
(%i12) A : apply(sconcat,create_list("1",i,1,500))$
Evaluation took 0.0000 seconds (0.0070 elapsed)
(%i13) with_stdout("test.txt", for i : 1 thru 100000 do print(A))$
Evaluation took 7.1600 seconds (7.4840 elapsed)
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> However, in C++, this would take a fraction of a section,
   and even in interpreted languages like python, this takes
   only 0.2 seconds. </li>
   <li> MG has sent an e-mail to the Maxima mailing list regarding
   this issue. </li>
   <li> It is suggested on the Maxima mailing list that the reason
   for slow printing is the checking and simplification Maxima performs
   on the expression passed to print. </li>
   <li> For faster output of strings, we should pass the output directly
   to lisp print functions.
   \verbatim
maxima> A : apply(sconcat,create_list("1",i,1,500))$
maxima> with_stdout("test.txt", for i : 1 thru 100000 do print(A))$
Evaluation took 8.9100 seconds (9.1250 elapsed)
maxima> with_stdout("test.txt", for i : 1 thru 100000 do (?princ(A), ?terpri()))$
Evaluation took 3.3100 seconds (3.6900 elapsed)
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> Note that the lisp function princ doesn't print an extra space
   after the string, whereas Maxima's print function does. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Stable sorting
  <ul>
   <li> The documentation of "sort" doesn't say anything about the behaviour
   in case of equal items. </li>
   <li> So it could even not work at all in case of equal items! </li>
   <li> The documentation is also faulty w.r.t. whether the supplied predicate
   should be reflexive or irreflexive.
    <ol>
     <li> Actually from the documentation it should follow that equal elements
     can not be handled, since the predicate for subsequent elements shall
     be true, while the key example "orderlessp" is an irreflexive order! </li>
     <li> So it is not clear whether "<" or "<=" should be used. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Supposing that it works (it absolutely should!), without the
   specification one is in the worst situation: one has to assume that the
   order of equal elements is changed, without being able to rely on faster
   sorting. </li>
   <li> See "Simplifications" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/PseudoBoolean/plans/CardinalityConstraints.hpp
   for an example of this problem. </li>
   <li> Also min_elements_l and max_elements_l in
   ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/SetSystems.mac rely on sort being stable.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \bug DONE (resolved with version 5.21.1)
  Strings cause errors in evaluation of expressions
  <ul>
   <li> Once there is anywhere a string, ">" can not be applied anymore:
   \verbatim
(%i1) is("x">0);
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:
 "x" is not of type LIST.
(%i2) is(f("x")>0);
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:
 "x" is not of type LIST.
(%i3) declare(f, posfun);
(%i4) is(f(1) > 0);
(%o4) true
(%i5) is(f("x") > 0);
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:
 "x" is not of type LIST.
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> DONE Notify the Maxima mailing-list. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE (transferred to docus)
  Restricted recursion for memoised functions
  <ul>
   <li> Consider
   \verbatim
fib_mem[n] := if n <= 1 then n else fib_mem[n-1] + fib_mem[n-2];

fib_mem[6100];
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:
 C-STACK overflow at size 8421376. Stack can probably be resized.
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> In Ecl we can resize the c-stack:
   \verbatim
get_c_stack_ecl();
  8421376
set_c_stack_ecl(2^24);
  16777216

is(fib_mem[6100] = fib(6100));
  true
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> Another (general) possibility is to write for memoised
   recursive functions a wrapper which calls the function bottom-up. </li>
   <li>
   \verbatim
_fib_mem[n] := if n <= 1 then n else _fib_mem[n-1] + _fib_mem[n-2]$
fib_mem(n) := (for i : 0 thru n-1 do _fib_mem[i], _fib_mem[n])$
is(fib_mem(6100) = fib(6100));
  true
   \endverbatim
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Memoised functions
  <ul>
   <li> Consider
      \verbatim
_fib_mem[n] := if n <= 1 then n else _fib_mem[n-1] + _fib_mem[n-2]$
fib_mem(n) := (for i : 0 thru n-1 do _fib_mem[i], _fib_mem[n])$
is(fib_mem(6100) = fib(6100));
  true
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> It would be better if one could find out whether the value _fib_mem[n]
   is already defined. </li>
   <li> Then fib_mem would first check whether _fib_mem[n] is already defined,
   and only if this is not the case would it run through the loop. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Argument-length restriction
  <ul>
   <li> In CLisp we have the very restrictive maximal argument-lenght of
   4095 (at least on 32-bit machines), which is better in ECL (2^16),
   however in CLisp "union" can be applied to arbitrarily many arguments,
   while in ECL it is restricted by the maximal argumenent-length. </li>
   <li> We need to find out about these restrictions, and its variations.
   </li>
   <li> Perhaps the cmucl is the only usable Lisp, since apparently it does
   not pose any restriction on the argument-length? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo How to use function-parameters reliably??
  <ul>
   <li> The biggest problem with Maxima is that function-parameters are
   not handled properly, not even the arguments of lambda-terms. </li>
   <li> It is unclear what actually happens, but names of parameter, which
   take functions or lambda-terms as values, must be all different!
    <ol>
     <li> On the other hand, calling test-functions from other test-functions
     doesn't cause problems. </li>
     <li> We need clear examples, where errors occur. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> It seems that nested function calls though are not a problem (this
   would render it hopeless!). </li>
   <li> This must be discussed on the Maxima mailing list (but I (OK) fear
   nothing will happen).
    <ol>
     <li> Take as example "every_s" from
     ComputerAlgebra/DataStructures/Lisp/Lists.mac (how to write it
     properly). </li>
     <li> If the function-parameter would be called "npred", then
     "okltest_some_ndiag_scom_p" in
     ComputerAlgebra/CombinatorialMatrices/Lisp/tests/Basics.mac
     runs into an infinite loop. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> One thing is to reserve names for the library:
    <ol>
     <li> Everything that starts with "_". </li>
     <li> Then we have "f"; likely we should rename it everywhere to "_f".
     </li>
     <li> Or perhaps "f" is an exception. </li>
     <li> Within the library, parameters naming functions must always be
     somewhat longer and specific (except of "f"); and they start with "_".
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Problems with errcatch
  <ul>
   <li> We get an error message
   \verbatim
errcatch(map(0,[]));
Improper name or value in functional position:
0
   \endverbatim
   which shouldn't be the case. </li>
   <li> Contact the Maxima mailing list. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo What is "equalp" ?
  <ul>
   <li> It seems impossible to evaluate "equalp(0,0)" sensibly?? </li>
   <li> is(equalp(0,0)) returns "unknown" ? </li>
   <li> So then the only sensible check for being zero is
   \verbatim
is(equal(x,0))
   \endverbatim
   ?? (yielding true,false, or unknown) </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Maxima/CLisp bug for larger data-sets
  <ul>
   <li> On csltok (laptop of OK) running
   \verbatim
oklib_store : true;
set_random_state(make_random_state(0));
all_unsinghitting_mvd(8, 'all_n8);
   \endverbatim
   produced a segmentation fault after running a bit more than
   214 hours (nearly 9 full days). </li>
   <li> Apparently this just happened when writing the session file. </li>
   <li> A core-file has been produced --- how to analyse this? </li>
   <li> When by mistake printing out the repository to the screen, I
   got "string too long: desired length 6553600 exceeds the supported maximum
   length". </li>
   <li> So perhaps Maxima, when writing the file, just puts everything into a
   big string, and then the error occurred when this string was too long?
    <ol>
     <li> We had one slightly bigger file in the past; however this contained
     the annotation-strings. </li>
     <li> So perhaps each value is transformed into a string, and now a single
     value (the hash-map), was too big? </li>
     <li> Repeating the experiment with seed 10 produced after nearly the same
     running time again a segmentation fault, so the string-problem should be
     the cause. </li>
     <li> With seed 11, at nearly the same file size the segmentation
     fault happened, but this time the file was apparently correctly
     written, and the fault happened a bit after writing the file? </li>
     <li> On cs-wsok, a 64-bit machine, these errors don't happen. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Tell the Maxima mailing-list about that and ask for a different "save",
   call it "fsave" (fast save):
    <ol>
     <li> No list-annotations. </li>
     <li> No unnecessary spaces. </li>
     <li> Values are broken into small strings, if necessary. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo General design: Lists *here* are more fundamental than sets
  <ul>
   <li> It seems that instead of clause-sets we should use clause-lists
   as the fundamental objects. </li>
   <li> In the mathematical cosmos there is no creation and destruction,
   thus no order, however in the computational cosmos there is before
   and after, construction and destruction. </li>
   <li> In this way we obtain control over enumeration aspects.
    <ol>
     <li> Typically the enumeration is controlled by ordering the
     elements of certain sets. </li>
     <li> Yet this done by applying listify, thus without control. </li>
    </ol>
    Now, when enumerating all possibilities in some function:
    <ol>
     <li> Either the given orders are used. </li>
     <li> Or random_permutation is applied. </li>
     <li> Perhaps we have a global flag "oklib_randomise_order", which
     controls this behaviour. </li>
     <li> In this way we have a simple way of random sampling. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> But clauses should stay as sets. </li>
   <li> A formal clause-list has then also a list of variables (without
   repetition). </li>
   <li> An "ordered hypergraph" is then also given as a list of hyperedges,
   together with a list of vertices (the latter without repetition). </li>
   <li> But the hyperedges still are sets. </li>
   <li> In the same vein, "ordered graphs" are given by lists of vertices and
   lists of edges, the former without repetition, the latter with sets as
   elements. </li>
   <li> So it seems that we should rewrite all of of the Maxima-functions.
   </li>
   <li> This combined with the general clean-up. </li>
   <li> The clause-sets etc. are still available, via conversions. </li>
   <li> What about combinatorial matrices? Their point is, after all,
   the order-*independence* ?!
    <ol>
     <li> So perhaps they stay as they are, using index-sets? </li>
     <li> However, there are the same issues regarding enumerations. </li>
     <li> So we should have also "ordered combinatorial matrices", where
     indices are given by 2 lists. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> We use the adjective "ordered" as follows:
    <ol>
     <li> Speaking of "ordered clause-sets", "ordered graphs",
     "ordered hypergraphs" etc. </li>
     <li> Different from the "list-types", here we do not have
     multiple occurrences. </li>
     <li> So an "ordered clause-set" is the same structure as a "clause-list",
     but we do not have multiple occurrences of the same clause (while an
     "clause-list" may have them). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Handling the multiplicity of types:
    <ol>
     <li> We do not introduce abstraction at the Maxima/Lisp level (except
     of the "mathematical abstraction" given by using terms and functions).
     </li>
     <li> Functions are implemented for the appropriate input-types (formal
     clause-sets, or just clause-sets, etc.). </li>
     <li> The user applies conversions. </li>
     <li> What about providing convenience functions, which just convert their
     argument, and then apply the main function:
      <ol>
       <li> It seems to me (OK), that this just yields confusion, since for
       some functions we have it, for some others we don't. </li>
       <li> So we should have different versions only in case they really
       implement different behaviour! </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Plan the redesign
  <ul>
   <li> Making lists fundamental, and introducing new and consistent naming
   conventions. </li>
   <li> See "Redesign" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> See "Redesign" in ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> See "Redesign" in ComputerAlgebra/Graphs/Lisp/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> See "Concepts and abbreviations" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Trees/Lisp/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Recovering of partial results after long (unsuccessful) computations
  <ul>
   <li> See "all_unsinghitting" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/ConflictCombinatorics/HittingClauseSets.mac
   for an example how to pass variable-names as parameters, and how to store
   the elements of the result-set piecewise in this variable. </li>
   <li> And see all_hitting_DP_reductions_def in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/ConflictCombinatorics/HittingClauseSets.mac
   for a more advanced example how to make make these recovering-variables
   optional; here we have also a state-variable (the permutation count),
   which allows re-starting the computation from an arbitrary point. </li>
   <li> In this way we should rewrite all functions which perform long
   computations, and for which it makes sense to collect partial results. </li>
   <li> Using "oklib --maxima -g", a running computation can be interrupted by
   Ctrl-C, a variable "var" can be displayed by "$var" (using "(displa $var)"
   one gets Maxima-representation), and by "continue" (at
   break-level 1 !) the computation can be continued.
    <ol>
     <li> Does this slow down computations? Some tests seem to indicate that
     this is not the case. </li>
     <li> So perhaps this should be our default? </li>
     <li> If something goes wrong with displaying values, then suddenly
     "continue" doesn't work anymore (but is treated as variable name)?!? </li>
     <li> And also for some other reasons continuation becomes impossible??
     (Then we don't have a "Continuable Error"). </li>
     <li> This looks like a clisp compiler weakness. Perhaps with 2.44.1 this
     is solved? </li>
     <li> Perhaps the problem is that when the execution is inside a
     sub-function then continuation is not possible? </li>
     <li> Anyway, this mechanism doesn't look really reliable yet. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Using "oklib_save()" in a functions stores the whole state
   of Maxima to a session file, after oklib_storage_interval
   minutes have passed, given that oklib_store is true.
    <ol>
     <li> This should be applied throughout. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Debugging
  <ul>
   <li> Again and again it happens that somehow the Lisp-debugger is entered,
   and apparently there is NO ESCAPE (":top" apparently should be the escape,
   but doesn't work). </li>
   <li> How to disable the debugger ?? </li>
  </ul>

  
  \todo Documentation
  <ul>
   <li> A work-around to obtain doxygen-documentation:
    <ol>
     <li> The solution seems to be to start the .mac-files
     with the usual preamble, and then via "\htmlonly" and
     "\endhtmlonly" to suppress the extraction of code-comments
     (the source code is shown verbatim!). </li>
     <li> We should discuss this on the doxygen mailing list:
     Perhaps a dedicated doxygen-command could be introduced? </li>
     <li> Or should one use the verbatim-commands? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> How to create function-documentation inside Maxima (usable via
   "? function-name") ? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Handling of demos
  <ul>
   <li> The demos-files are put into demos-subdirectory, and are plain
   .mac-files (intended to be processed). </li>
   <li> How to run the maxima-demos-files?
    <ol>
     <li> Apparently, "batch" is when we want to "run through it", while
     "demo" is when we want to pause after each expression. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> How to name the demos-files?
    <ol>
     <li> If the demonstration accompanies a file, then it has the same name.
     </li>
     <li> Otherwise any appropriate name. </li>
     <li> The suffix ".dem" is mentioned in the Maxima-manual. This or
     ".mac" ?! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> How to create pauses?
    <ol>
     <li> On a global level one has the distinction between "oklib_batch"
     and "oklib_demo". </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Integrate the demos into the test-system. </li>
   <li> DONE How to print out explanations?
    <ol>
     <li> The problem is that when using "batch" or "demo", where expressions
     are reported before being printed, the explanations, for which we only
     have the print-statement, are printed twice?? </li>
     <li> The solution seems to be to use just the expression
     \verbatim
"Text to be shown"$
     \endverbatim
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE How is it integrated into the general demos-system for the
   OKlibrary? Likely nothing special is done, only we need load-capabilities,
   likely here only for single files. </li>
   <li> DONE (oklib_batch, oklib_demo)
   Extend "oklib_load" to process the maxima-demos? Perhaps better
   a dedicated function. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Monitoring
  <ul>
   <li> We introduce a global variable "oklib_monitor",
   which our functions can use, and if set to true then they
   output progress information. </li>
   <li> Additionally we have "oklib_monitor_level":
    <ol>
     <li> The default is level 0, meaning that only basic messages
     are print. </li>
     <li> Greater values are then used at the discretion of the affected
     function. </li>
     <li> "inf" always indicates full output. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> This output should happen in a standardised way, so that
   the source of the output is recognisable.
    <ol>
     <li> We use "M[function_name]:" to start the message. </li>
     <li> Perhaps we can offer some general services, like functions
     which print the opening and ending. Something similar to the
     Messages-system for C++ perhaps.
      <ul>
       <li> But we don't consider internationalisation. </li>
       <li> And, of course, no compile-time-issues. </li>
       <li> Is there a general facility to find out the current
       function? Otherwise perhaps we use some standard variable,
       which is then set to the name of the function. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The monitoring code uglifies the procedure:
    <ol>
     <li> Could there be a general scheme, that certain variables are
     watched and printed if they changed value, and this happens
     non-intrusively? But we need dedicated text etc., so this doesn't
     seem to hlep.</li>
     <li> Or functions which support monitoring come in two versions?
     This would created too much code-bloat. </li>
     <li> Output should always happen via helper-functions, so the
     interruption is minimal. Standard: "monitorcheck". </li>
     <li> This procedure just inherits all variable etc. via
     dynamic binding. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE For the introduction of "oklib_monitor", apparently
   "define_variable" should be used? </li>
   <li> See first examples:
    <ol>
     <li> ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Resolution/Basics.mac </li>
     <li> ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Backtracking/DLL_solvers.mac
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Contexts
  <ul>
   <li> There is the notion of a "context" --- what does it mean? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Lisp integration
  <ul>
   <li> The Lisp-dialect is "CLisp" --- are there books? </li>
   <li> How to integrate CLisp with Maxima ? </li>
   <li> Shouldn't we consider our code as Lisp-code, which uses the
   maxima-library ? Perhaps we can discuss this on the Maxima mailing
   list. </li>
  </ul>
     
     
  \todo Collaboration with the Maxima community
  <ul>
   <li> On the plans for the "Google Summer of code" at
   http://maxima.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Design%20Notes
   there are quite some overlaps with the OKlibrary (especially
   regarding "Boolean algebra and logic"). </li>
   <li> At some point we should contact "the Maxima community",
   and discuss possibilities for collaborations:
    <ol>
     <li> The OKlibrary uses the Maxima-level only for
     "procedural specifications". </li>
     <li> So the Maxima community can use this as a map for the whole
     field, and produce some specific more efficient implementations at
     the Lisp level. </li>
     <li> Of course, also input on the use of Maxima in the OKlibrary would
     be welcome. </li>
     <li> And doxygen support for Maxima would be great. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> A "Logic Algebra" (title of the email) module has been submitted to the
   maxima mailing list for consideration for inclusion in share/contrib and is 
   viewable at http://beshenov.ru/maxima/logic/ . Perhaps some collaboration
   could initially occur here? </li>
  </ul>

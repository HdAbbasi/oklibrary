  \brief General plans regarding the Maxima computer algebra system


  \todo Debugging
  <ul>
   <li> Again and again it happens that somehow the Lisp-debugger is entered,
   and apparently there is NO ESCAPE (":top" apparently should be the escape,
   but doesn't work). </li>
   <li> How to disable the debugger ?? </li>
  </ul>
  
  \todo Documentation
  <ul>
   <li> A work-around to obtain doxygen-documentation:
    <ol>
     <li> The solution seems to be to start the .mac-files
     with the usual preamble, and then via "\htmlonly" and
     "\endhtmlonly" to surpress the extraction of code-comments
     (the source code is shown verbatim!). </li>
     <li> We should discuss this on the doxygen mailing list:
     Perhaps a dedicated doxygen-command could be introduced? </li>
     <li> Or should one use the verbatim-commands? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> How to create function-documentation inside Maxima (usable via
   "? function-name") ? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Handling of demos
  <ul>
   <li> The demos-files are put into demos-subdirectory, and are plain
   .mac-files (intented to be processed). </li>
   <li> How to call the maxima-demos-files? </li>
   <li> How to print out explanations? </li>
   <li> How to create pauses? </li>
   <li> How is it integrated into the general demos-system for the OKlibrary?
   Likely nothing special is done, only we need load-capabilities, likely
   here only for single files. </li>
   <li> Extend "oklib_load" to process the maxima-demos? Perhaps better
   a dedicated function. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo New module "Trees" : DONE


  \todo Monitoring
  <ul>
   <li> We introduce a global variable "oklib_monitor",
   which our functions can use, and if set to true then they
   output progress information. </li>
   <li> Additionally we have "oklib_monitor_level":
    <ol>
     <li> The default is level 0, meaning that only basic messages
     are print. </li>
     <li> Greater values are then used at the discretion of the affected
     function. </li>
     <li> "inf" always indicates full output. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> This output should happen in a standardised way, so that
   the source of the output is recognisable.
    <ol>
     <li> We use "M[function_name]:" to start the message. </li>
     <li> Perhaps we can offer some general services, like functions
     which print the opening and ending. Something similar to the
     Messages-system for C++ perhaps.
      <ul>
       <li> But we don't consider internationalisation. </li>
       <li> And, of course, no compile-time-issues. </li>
       <li> Is there a general facility to find out the current
       function? Otherwise perhaps we use some standard variable,
       which is then set to the name of the function. </li>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The monitoring code uglifies the procedure:
    <ol>
     <li> Could there be a general scheme, that certain variables are
     watched and printed if they changed value, and this happens
     non-intrusively? But we need dedicated text etc., so this doesn't
     seem to hlep.</li>
     <li> Or functions which support monitoring come in two versions?
     This would created too much code-bloat. </li>
     <li> Output should always happen via helper-functions, so the
     interruption is minimal. Standard: "monitorcheck". </li>
     <li> This procedure just inherits all variable etc. via
     dynamic binding. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> For the introduction of "oklib_monitor", apparently "define_variable"
   should be used? </li>
   <li> See first examples:
    <ol>
     <li> ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Resolution/Basics.mac </li>
     <li> ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Backtracking/DLL_solvers.mac </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>


  \todo Timing
  <ul>
   <li> Is there a timing command ? </li>
   <li> "time (%o1, %o2, %o3, ...)" returns the time it took to
   compute the respective outputs. </li>
   <li> With "showtime: true " Maxima outputs the timing result
   after each computation. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Local variables
  <ul>
   <li> How to make sure, that variables are local? </li>
   <li> Is "local" needed? For what is it good for? </li>
   <li> It seems not necessary to protect the parameter, or? </li>
   <li> Can everything done with "block" ? </li>
   <li> How to obtain information about symbols (so that for example clashes
   can be avoided) ? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Global variables
  <ul>
   <li> Under "reset" there is some Maxima-information about global variables.
   Unclear whether we should use this. </li>
   <li> See "Variables" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/ClauseSets/plans/Generators.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Function application
  <ul>
   <li> What is the difference between "apply" and "xreduce" ? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo List operations
  <ul>
   <li> A frequent operation is to add an element x to a list L
   *in-place*. </li>
   <li> Apparently the most efficient operations seems to be
   <code>L : cons(x,L)</code> resp. <code>L : endcons(x,L)</code>,
   where both operations seem to take place not in-place, but involve
   copying and re-assignment, making it very inefficient?? </li>
   <li> In general we want to avoid any efficiency-considerations, however
   having in-place modifications of lists would also increase ease of
   use. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Document important programming techniques:
  <ul>
   <li> How to handle local variables (see above).
    <ol>
     <li> A source of errors regarding the block-expression is that
     returns inside it just leave *this* block --- so one has to
     be careful by introducing blocks (since they change the semantics)! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> All different types of loops (see the existing code).
   Especially nested loops ("create_list"). </li>
   <li> How to create lambda-terms (see the existing code). </li>
   <li> Function-application (also "map" etc.; see above). </li>
   <li> Hash tables
    <ol>
     <li> Package "graphs" establishes the following interface to
     lisp-hash-tables. </li>
     <li> First use "load(graphs);" </li>
     <li> Via "h : hash_table()" a new hash table is created. </li>
     <li> Via "set_hash("abc", h, 78)" we set h("abc") = 78. </li>
     <li> Via "get_hash("abc", h)" we get (h("abc") if defined, and
     false otherwise. </li>
     <li> And via "hash_table_data(h)" we get the list of all assignments
     in h.
      <ol>
       <li> For an assignment A ("x -> y") we obtain the argument by
       "part(A,1)" and the value by "part(A,2)". </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Dynamic binding: Important to understand this, since nowadays
   static binding is most common. </li>
   <li> Arbitrary precision:
    <ol>
     <li> For a local computation Comp with d decimal digits use
     \verbatim
block([fpprec : fpprec], fpprec : d, Comp)
     \endverbatim
     </li>
     <li> Numbers used in Comp must be converted to bfloat, since otherwise
     exact computations are used, while number-literals like
     "1.0" are by default interpreted as float. </li>
     <li> However numerical procedures often enforce usage of type
     float (for example "newton"), and thus can't be used (succesfully)
     in Comp. </li>
     <li> It seems that an expression involving some bfloat-argument
     is always evaluated in bfloat-arithmetic. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Partial compilation:
  <ul>
   <li> "compfile" writes Lisp-code into files? </li>
   <li> It seems that we should use "compile(all)" from time to time, and also
   with "oklib".
    <ol>
     <li> There are warnings about undefined global variables, but since they
     involve even for example "inf" it seems we can ignore these warnings? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Lisp integration
  <ul>
   <li> The Lisp-dialect is "CLisp" --- are there books? </li>
   <li> How to integrate CLisp with Maxima ? </li>
   <li> Shouldn't we consider our code as Lisp-code, which uses the
   maxima-library ? Perhaps we can discuss this on the Maxima mailing
   list. </li>
  </ul>

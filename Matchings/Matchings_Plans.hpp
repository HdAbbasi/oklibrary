  \brief Matching algorithms for graphs (in the Boost sense)
  \todo First concepts for bipartite graphs are needed.
  Then as a first simple algorithm, a matching problem
  is reduced to a network flow problem, so that the maximum
  flow algorithms from Boost can be used.
  Then perhaps the basic direct algorithm ("Hungarian method")
  for finding maximum matchings.

  \brief Plans for literals

  \todo Traits-functions:
  - Literals/traits/var_type.hpp : Is this the right place for the var-implementation?
  - Literals/traits/cond_type.hpp : Is this the right place for the cond-implementation?

  \todo Implement trivial literals
  (like trivial variables, but now only used signed integral types)

  \todo First prototype
  Very first prototype for "signed literals" (set-valued literals).
  Based (of course) on Concepts/Literals.hpp. Perhaps first the
  notion of the "atomic condition" (use of "sets") needs to be
  clarified.

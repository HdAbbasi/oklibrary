  \brief Plans for local search algorithms in general


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Generic algorithm
  <ul>
   <li> A generic local search algorithm is needed, optimising an
   arbitrary function relative to a set of "local moves"
   at each point, one of which is chosen according to the heuristics. </li>
  </ul>

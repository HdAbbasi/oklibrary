  \par Current version 0.0.2 (12.11.2006)

  \par Version 0.0.3
  Further milestones, leading to 0.1, have been created.

  \par Version 0.1
  In LatinSquares/plans/LatinSquares.hpp the following
  topics are handled:
  - Concepts
  - Review
  - Basic direct algorithms

  \par Version 0.2
  Basic implementations of LS(v_ij) are provided and tested:
  - the direct incoding as a clause-set (as always, non-boolean)
  - the direct encoding, but managed as a virtual clause-set

  \par Version 0.3
  A basic implementation of LS(v_ij) as an alliance of injectivity constraints
  is provided (just using basic components) and tested.

  \par Version 0.4
  A basic implementation MOS(v_ijk) as an alliance of injectivity constraints
  is provided and tested.

  \par Version 0.5
  A basic implementation MOLS(v_ijk) as an alliance of injectivity constraints
  is provided and tested.

  \par Version 1.0
  Interesting implementations and algorithms exist for LS, MOS and MOLS.

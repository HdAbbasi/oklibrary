  \brief Investigations into AES key discovery for one round AES with MixColumns

  \todo Using the canonical translation
  <ul>
   <li> Generating AES for 1 round (with MixColumns):
   \verbatim
maxima> num_rounds : 1$
maxima> num_columns : 4$
maxima> num_rows : 4$
maxima> exp : 8$
maxima> final_round_b : false$
maxima> box_tran : aes_ts_box$
maxima> seed : 1$
maxima> mc_tran : aes_mc_bidirectional$
maxima> output_ss_fcl_std(num_rounds, num_columns, num_rows, exp, final_round_b, box_tran, mc_tran)$
   \endverbatim
   and then we can generate a random assignment with the plaintext and 
   ciphertext, leaving the key unknown:
   \verbatim
maxima> output_ss_random_pc_pair(seed,num_rounds,num_columns,num_rows,exp,final_round_b);
   \endverbatim
   and the merging the assignment with the translation:
   \verbatim
shell> $OKlib/Experimentation/Investigations/Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/merge_cnf.sh ssaes_r1_c4_rw4_e8_f0.cnf ssaes_pkpair_r1_c4_rw4_e8_f0_s1.cnf > ssaes_r1_c4_rw4_e8_f0_keyfind.cnf
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> MG is running experiments with various solvers, but all are ongoing 
   (after a day). </li>
   <li> The next thing to try is replacing the boxes with the r_1 bases we 
   have. </li>
  </ul>

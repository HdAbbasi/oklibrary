  \brief Investigations into representations for components of the AES related to the SAT 2011 paper


  \todo Add links and update module structure
  <ul>
   <li> Todos and files in this module have been moved from the level
   above, links must be added here and the module updated in general
   to make each of the todos accessible. </li>
   <li> The general structure of the investigations (from arbitrary boolean
   functions to permutations and linear maps) needs to be expressed. </li>
   <li> The tasks are (at least):
   <ul>
    <li> Add links in this file to each of the individual files, and links
    from the level above to this level. </li>
    <li> Add links to external modules for each file for relevant information.
    </li>
    <li> For each of the following files, add information on how to generate
    each of the experiments, as well as a todo on creating submodules for
    each type of experiment (including separately methods of experimentation):
    <ul>
     <li> BoxMinimisation. </li>
     <li> BoxPrimeImplicates. </li>
     <li> FieldMulMinimisation. </li>
     <li> SboxMinimisation. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Move todos from BoxRepresentations into this file (as this module is
   precisely about box representations). </li>
  </ul>

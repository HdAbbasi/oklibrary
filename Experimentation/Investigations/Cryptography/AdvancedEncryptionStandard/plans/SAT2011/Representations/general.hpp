  \brief Investigations into representations for components of the AES related to the SAT 2011 paper


  \todo Add links and update module structure
  <ul>
   <li> Todos and files in this module have been moved from the level
   above, links must be added here and the module updated in general
   to make each of the todos accessible. </li>
   <li> The general structure of the investigations (from arbitrary boolean
   functions to permutations and linear maps) needs to be expressed. </li>
  </ul>

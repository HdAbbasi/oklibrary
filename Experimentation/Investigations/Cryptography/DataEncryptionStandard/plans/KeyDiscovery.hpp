  \brief On investigations into the Data Encryption Standard key discovery


  \todo Transferring the Argosat-desgen example
  <ul>
   <li> Exactly as with argosat-desgen-sat09.tar.bz2, we shall consider
   key 15FBC08D31B0D521, plaintext 038E596D4841D03B and ciphertext
   A2FB6032638EC79D, and providing the examples for all 0 <= p <= 64,
   where the last p keybits are provided (as unit-clauses). </li>
   <li> This can be easily achieved by using function des_key2fcl(key),
   where the first 64-p entries of the 64-bit vector key' are replaced by
   the value "und" (while by hexstr2binv(key) we obtain the key as boolean
   vector). </li>
   <li> Their benchmarks only consider 13 <= 64-p <= 34, d.h.,
   30 <= p <= 51, however we can consider the whole range. </li>
   <li> We consider then all translations, and also many solvers. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Move into separate sub-module

  \brief On investigations regarding groupoids and specialisations (semigroups, quasigroups etc.)

  Counting and classifying groups is very likely far remote from (current,
  generalised) SAT, due to the very special methods involved (according
  to the standard reached). However groupoids in their "randomness" are far
  closer in spirit; finding special groupoids is definitely appropriate for
  generalised SAT, and then counting and classifying such structures is just
  the task of solving the conditions for all solutions (possibly up to
  isomorphisms).

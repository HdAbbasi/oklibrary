  \brief Plans regarding minimal unsatisfiable clause-sets


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> W.r.t. the classification of unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets see
   Experimentation/Investigations/UHittingCatalogue/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Understanding the recursion for non-Mersenne numbers
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (see [Kullmann Zhao, SAT 2011]
   How to prove that nonmersenne_rec[k] and
   nonmersenne_law(k) in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/MinimalUnsatisfiability/Basics.mac
   are the same functions? </li>
   <li> Can we determine which i in the recursive formula
   nm(k) = max_{i in {2,...,k} min(2*i, nm(k-i+1)+i)
   are relevant?
    <ol>
     <li> Analysing the patterns:
     \verbatim
for k : 2 thru 70 do print(k, analyse_nonmersenne_rec(k));

  \brief Plans on investigating size-bounded transversals of hypergraphs


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See Combinatorics/Hypergraphs/Transversals/Bounded/plans/general.hpp
   for components at C++ level. </li>
   <li> One main application is to compute minimum CNF/DNF representations; see
   Investigations/BooleanFunctions/MinimumRepresentations/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> Another main application area are the transversal numbers of various
   hypergraphs from Ramsey theory (vdW-related); see
   Investigations/RamseyTheory/GreenTaoProblems/Transversals/plans/general.hpp
   and
   Investigations/RamseyTheory/VanderWaerdenProblems/Transversals/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Overview
  <ul>
   <li> We need an overview and links to all methods. </li>
  </ul>

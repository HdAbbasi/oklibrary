  \brief Plans regarding experiments with visualisation of trees.


  \todo Splitting trees.
  <ul> 
   <li> Pure splitting trees are a starting point. </li>
   <li> For generators, see ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators
   </li>
   <li> For solvers, see
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Backtracking/DLL_solvers.mac </li>
   <li> Further problems: Ramsey problems. See
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/RamseyTheory/. For more
   information, refer to Experimentation/Investigations/RamseyTheory </li>

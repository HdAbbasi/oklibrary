  \brief Plans regarding SAT competitions


  \todo Benchmarks for SAT 2011
  <ul>
   <li> We should submit benchmarks for the SAT-2011-competition. </li>
   <li> Likely only things where we have published something (to be cited).
   </li>
   <li> So for this year it should be Green-Tao and van-der-Waerden instances.
   </li>
   <li> And also AES-related instances are of interest. </li>
   <li> See "Prepare benchmarks for SAT 2011" in
   RamseyTheory/GreenTaoProblems/plans/general.hpp,
   RamseyTheory/VanderWaerdenProblems/plans/general.hpp,
   Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/SAT2011/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> Best in every series to have a mixture, from known to unknown
   instances, from not-too-hard to likely-very-hard. </li>
   <li> What is the format? </li>
   <li> What are the categories? </li>
  </ul>

  \brief General plans regarding investigations on Folkman problems

  The hyperedges of "Folkman problems" are of the form
  {x_1, ..., x_k, s_1, ..., s_m}, where k >= 1, m = 2^k-1-k, and where the s_i
  correspond to the non-empty sums of the x_i. The standard versions don't
  require the x_i to be distinct, while the injective version do require it.

  The numbers are called folkman_r(k_1, ..., k_r) resp.
  folkmani_r(k_1, ..., k_r).

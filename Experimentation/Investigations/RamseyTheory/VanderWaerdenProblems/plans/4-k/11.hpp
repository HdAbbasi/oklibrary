  \brief On investigations into vdw_2(4,11)


  \todo Best ubcsat-solver
  <ul>
   <li> We need to find the best algorithm from the ubcsat-1-2-0 suite. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo vanderwaerden_2(4,11) > 347
  <ul>
   <li> Start with the palindromic solution for n=347. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo vdw_2^pd(4,11) = (343,348)
  <ul>
   <li> Established by minisat-2.2.0. </li>
   <li> Do we have an easy-hard pattern based on parity? </li>
  </ul>

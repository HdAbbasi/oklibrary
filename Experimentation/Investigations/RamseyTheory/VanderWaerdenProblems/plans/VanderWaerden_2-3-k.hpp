  \brief On investigations into vdW-numbers vdw_2(3,k)
  
  
  \todo Literature overview
  <ul>
   <li> A conjecture seems to be that vdw_2(3,k) <= k^2 for k >= 3. </li>
   <li> The known values with k=1, ..., 16:
   \verbatim
k vdw_2(3,k)
1 3
2 6
3 9

16 238
   \endverbatim
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Performance of OKsolver-2002
  <ul>
   <li> k=16, n=238: Running it with monitoring level 20 appears hopeless.
   And using the m2pp-variant doesn't make a difference, since the
   preprocessor has no effect. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Performance of march_pl


  \todo Performance of satz215


  \todo Performance of minisat2
  <ul>
   <li> k=16, n=238: Apparently after 30 restarts and 36906145 conflicts
   no progress was made. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Local search for the satisfiable instances
  <ul>
   <li> The first impression is that ubcsat::samd is best. </li>
   <li> For k=16, n=237 a local minimum of 1 is easily found (even with just
   100000 steps), while to find a solution one should use, say, 10^7 steps
   (and then solutions seem to be found often, e.g., seed=370833091). </li>
  </ul>

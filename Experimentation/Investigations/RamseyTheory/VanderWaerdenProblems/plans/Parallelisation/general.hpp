  \brief Using parallel SAT solving for van-der-Waerden problems

  Collaboration of OK, YP.


  \todo Cryptominisat
  <ul>
   <li> Running on a machine (YP, Dawning 5000A/compute-0-80) with 8 quadcore
   cpu's as follows:
   \verbatim
$ more /proc/cpuinfo
model name	: Quad-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 8350
cpu MHz		: 2008.985
cache size	: 512 KB
cpu cores	: 4
bogomips	: 4019.73
   \endverbatim
   we get
   \verbatim
$ time ./cryptominisat --threads=4 VanDerWaerden_2-3-12_135.cnf
c conflicts                : 2703221
real	25m4.821s
user	82m21.972s
sys	0m9.289s
   \endverbatim
   (user-time is sum over all threads) while with 32 threads after 10h of
   total running time still no result was obtained (this might be due to
   scheduling problems). </li>
   <li> One needs to re-run these experiments when nothing else runs on thes
   machine. </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  \todo Simple parallelisation via OKsolver-2002
  <ul>
   <li> See Solvers/OKsolver/SAT2002/plans/SimpleParallelisation.hpp. </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  \todo Parallel Satz
  <ul>
   <li> See "Satz" in Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/SAT.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  \todo Using Open MPI
  <ul>
   <li> It seems that to run even the "simple parallelisation" provided e.g.
   by the OKsolver-2002 (see above) on a "supercomputer" (like "Dawning
   5000A"; see above) one needs to utilise the Open-Mpi-interface. </li>
   <li> See http://www.open-mpi.org. </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  \todo Verify vdw_2(4,9) = 309 (conjectured)
  <ul>
   <li> See 
   Investigations/RamseyTheory/VanderWaerdenProblems/plans/4-k/09.hpp. </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  \todo Verify vdw_2(5,7) = 260 (conjectured)
  <ul>
   <li> See 
   Investigations/RamseyTheory/VanderWaerdenProblems/plans/5-k/07.hpp. </li>

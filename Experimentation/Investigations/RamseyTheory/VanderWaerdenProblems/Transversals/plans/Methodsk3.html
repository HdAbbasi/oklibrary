Split x+y

<B>a(x+y)<=2a(x)+a(y)-1</B> if x>=y.

Product x*y

<B>m(x*y)<=m(x)*m(y)</B>.

Wrap

<B>m(x)<=2a(x)-1</B>.

<B>m(x)<=m(x+1)</B>.

Theorem N
</H2>

Let k<SUB>1</SUB>,k<SUB>2</SUB>,k<SUB>3</SUB>,...,k<SUB>N</SUB>
be a nonaveraging modular solution mod P,
an increasing sequence of <B>positive</B> integers.
Then for r=1,2,3,...,N
<BR>
<B>a(N*(q-1)+r)<=P*(a(q)-1)+k<SUB>r</SUB></B>.
<BR>
Note 1. If we have one modular solution, we can produce all
its linear transformations, as there may be different particular solutions suitable for various r.
<BR>
Note 2. Modular solutions are not turned automatically into theorems
at the moment.
<BR>
Note 3. It is unlikely but possible that a modular solution that is
not improving known bound on m(n) (and therefore not saved by
verification program) can still be useful. I will develope a way to check
it. If you know it is useful send it to my <A HREF="mailto:jwr@math.uni.wroc.pl">
"human"</A> address.

Search
</H2>

Direct search if everything above has failed.
Sometimes this is like guesswork, as in case of m(216)<=3889, where
I took 216-th roots of unity (or 18th nonzero powers) mod 3889.

# "RunPdVdW3k k1 k2 alg runs cutoff" creates a directory
# "Exp_PdVanderWaerden_2-k1-k2_alg-runs-cutoff_date", where the SAT instances
# VanDerWaerden_pd_2-k1-k2_n.cnf for n = k2, k2+1, ... are created
# and ubcsat-okl with parameters alg, runs, cutoff is executed on
# these instances, storing the output in VanDerWaerden_pd_2-k1-k2_n.cnf_OUT.
# If a solution was found, then it is stored in
# VanDerWaerden_pd_2-k1-k2_n.cnf_sol.

# A solution found for n-2 is used as the initial ubcsat-assignment for n.
# Once the first phase is finised, that is, the first unsatisfiable
# instance was found (that is, heuristically determined as unsat),
# the second phase is entered, where in steps of +2 the search advances
# to the next potentially satisfiable instance, skipping the unsatisfiable
# instance inbetween. The third phase is entered once the second unsatisfiable
# instance is found in this way.
# The results are two n-values n1, n2: n1 is maximal such that for all n <= n1
# the instances are satisfiable, while n2 is minimal such that for all n >= n2
# the instances are unsatisfiable (always heuristically).

# The parameters of the script can be found in file "Parameters" within the
# experiment-directory, and the results are in file "Results".

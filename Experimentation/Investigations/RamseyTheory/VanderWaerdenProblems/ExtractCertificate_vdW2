# "ExtractCertificate_vdW2 file" assumes that "file" contains the output of
# ubcsat-okl when using option -solve, and this for a boolean vdW-Problem
# where a solution was found.
# It extracts then the variables assigned a positive value, that is, the
# vertices belonging to the first block of the 2-partitioning.
# The output-format is that of a (Maxima-)list, that is, the numbers are
# separated by commas.

  \todo Best local search algorithm
  <ul>
   <li> ubcsat-okl -runs 10 -cutoff 10000 -i GreenTao_4-3_400.cnf yields
   the following means for the different algorithms:
   \verbatim
gsat 36
gsat -v simple 37.2
gwsat 31.1
gsat-tabu 21.7
hsat 36.1
hwsat 35.4
walksat 84.3
walksat-tabu 48.6
walksat-tabu -v nonull 49.7
novelty 51
novelty+ 50.7
adaptnovelty+ 22.2
rnovelty 53.6
rnovelty+ 49.7
saps 41.6
rsaps 37.8
sapsnr 42.3
rots 21.2
irots 38.6
samd 20.9
   \endverbatim
   The best algorithms here are samd, rots, gsat-tabu and adaptnovelty+
   (in this order). </li>
   <li> With runs=100:
   \verbatim
samd 20.950000 FlipsPerSecond = 100301
gsat-tabu 21.1 FlipsPerSecond = 68634
rots 21.17 FlipsPerSecond = 77399
adaptnovelty+ 22.66 FlipsPerSecond = 473934
   \endverbatim
   So adaptnovelty+ is the weakest w.r.t. what is reached, but it is
   fastest by far. </li>
   <li> Now with cutoff=100*10^3:
   \verbatim
adaptnovelty+ 13.24 min = 8 FlipsPerSecond = 457666
samd 13.67 min = 10 FlipsPerSecond = 95157
gsat-tabu 13.75 min = 10 FlipsPerSecond = 94661
rots 18.34 min = 15 FlipsPerSecond = 79853
   \endverbatim
   So actually adaptnovelty+ seems best by far! </li>
   <li> With cutoff=10^6:
   \verbatim
adaptnovelty+ 9.41 min = 7
samd 11.37 min = 7
gsat-tabu 11.35 min = 8
rots 17.97 min = 15
   \endverbatim
   So adaptnovelty+ should be clearly the best. </li>
   <li> One needs to investigate preprocessing (together with symmetry
   breaking), whether this changes the picture. Using n=400 as above.
    <ol>
     <li> Just the minisat2-preprocessing alone makes things far worse:

adaptnovelty+ 15.2 min = 14
samd 80.4 min = 74
gsat-tabu 80.5 min = 71
rots 76.0 min = 72

walksat 116.5 min = 110
     \endverbatim
     Once we have the tools available, we need actually to reconsider all
     algorithms.
     </li>
     <li> Just symmetry-breaking alone:
     \verbatim
> ubcsat-okl -runs 10 -cutoff 1000000 -alg adaptnovelty+ -i GreenTao_sb_4-3_400.cnf
Clauses = 32367
Variables = 1600
TotalLiterals = 95095
FlipsPerSecond = 477555
BestStep_Mean = 525055.500000
Steps_Mean = 1000000.000000
Steps_Max = 1000000.000000
PercentSuccess = 0.00
BestSolution_Mean = 9.700000
BestSolution_Median = 10.000000
BestSolution_Min = 9.000000
BestSolution_Max = 11.000000

adaptnovelty+ 9.7 min = 9
samd 11.5 min = 9
gsat-tabu 11.1 min = 9
rots 17.8 min = 16
     \endverbatim
     So it doesn't seem to help (and perhaps it actually harms). Though one
     should definitely apply unit-clause propagation, and see whether this
     improves something. And again all algorithms need to be reexamined. </li>
     <li> Both together:
     \verbatim

PercentSuccess = 0.00
BestSolution_Mean = 15.300000
BestSolution_Median = 15.500000
BestSolution_Min = 12.000000

adaptnovelty+ 15.3 min = 12
samd 83.9  min = 73
gsat-tabu  min = 
rots 79.2 min = 64
     \endverbatim
     </li>
     <li> The first impression is that nothing can be achieved in this way.
     Perhaps there is a fundamental difference between DPLL-like SAT solvers
     and local-search SAT solvers: The former are strongest when some
     "structure" exists (in the form of "attackable points"), while the latter
     are strongest when the problems have a kind of "random" or "uniform"
     "(non-)structure". </li>
    </ol>

  \todo Upper bounds
  <ul>
   <li> From the experience with "greentao_3(3) = 137" (see
   Investigations/RamseyTheory/GreenTaoProblems/plans/general.hpp)
   it seems that minisat2 performs best here. </li>
   <li> One can employ symmetry breaking, but it likely can only achieve
   a speed-up by a factor 4 at best, and thus likely is not of much value.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Minisat2 for n=377
  <ul>
   <li> Running minisat2 on GreenTao_sb_4-3_376.cnf for a day (32 restarts)
   doesn't seem to make progress. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Picosat913 for n=377
  <ul>
   <li> Without preprocessing: Stopped after 2 days; the problem is that
   apparently there are no progress-indicators (or could one interprete "level"
   as such?), and so it's not possible to say whether any progress has been
   achieved. </li>
   <li> With minisat2 preprocessing: Stopped after 10 hours --- hard to
   tell the difference (and hard to see any progress due to the confusing
   output). </li>
  </ul>


  \todp Precosat236 for n=377
  <ul>
   <li> Stopped after 5 hours; same problem as with picosat, that there is
   no progress visible, and perhaps not even any such measurement (in the
   absence of fixed variables --- once one gets one fixed variables, then
   at least for these problems the solution is near). </li>
   <li> If there would be at least some documentation on those various outputs,
   then perhaps one could try to use this for some form of classification of
   problem types. </li>
  </ul>

   (without completing any monitor node at level 30; regarding the tree depth
   it looks even worse than without reprocessing, however this might be
   accidental, given the large search space). </li>
   <li> Interesting to note here that the number of variables and the number of
   2-clauses coincide: it might be that the reduction actually establishes

   without reaching any node at level 30; as with greentao_3(3), it looks much
   better when preprocessing and symmetry breaking are combined, which is
   strange. Also strange that suddenly there are nearly no single-nodes
   anymore? </li>
   <li> The above "symmetry breaking" is "simple symmetry breaking", which
   should be the right form since we have k=3 here throughout. </li>

  \brief General plans regarding investigations on %Ramsey theory (%Ramsey problems, van der Waerden problems, etc.)
  
  
  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Schur numbers
  <ul>
   <li> For a natural number r >= 1 the Schur-number schur(r) is the smallest
   n such that for every partition {1,...,n} at least one part contains a
   triple (x,y,z) with x+y=z. </li>
   <li> Apparently only schur(1)=2, schur(2)=5, schur(3)=14 and schur(4)=45
   are known. </li>
   <li> While schur(5)=160 is conjectured (research problem 8.1 in
   [Landman, Robertson, 2003]). This might be feasible, since the clause-set
   consists only of binary and ternary clauses. </li>
  </ul>

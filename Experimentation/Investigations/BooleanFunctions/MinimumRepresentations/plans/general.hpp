  \brief On investigations into minimum representations of boolean functions


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See Investigations/Transversals/Bounded/plans/general.hpp for
   investigations into our main method. </li>
   <li> See
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Resolution/PrimeImplicatesImplicants.mac
   for methods at Maxima level for computing minimum CNF/DNF representations.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Minimum CNF/DNF representations
  <ul>
   <li> We need an overview and links to all investigations related to
   computing minimum CNFs or DNFs of boolean functions. </li>
   <li> We need an overview and links to all methods and tools. </li>
   <li> Likely we need a dedicated submodule. </li>
  </ul>

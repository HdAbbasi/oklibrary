I The small AES Challenge

As a challenge to the SAT community, we present a SAT translation of the 
128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard cipher as a key discovery problem. 
The translation has been instantiated with a plaintext and a ciphertext, where 
the ciphertext was encrypted using a key determined by 128 flips of a 2001 
British pound coin. The key has now been destroyed and the only way to 
rediscover it is to solve this instance.

The challenge amounts to finding any key which encrypts the plaintext,

  CF964488F8FD93A6F30E9B4EDE0FE07E

to the ciphertext,

  3DE819D1BB624DDA35E4445D12C31762.

The Advanced Encryption Standard is a widely used encryption algorithm and 
solving this instance in a reasonable time would break the AES, and have
a significant impact in the cryptographic community.

We call the translation used to generate this instance, the minimum box 
translation. This translation uses minimum representations of the components 
of the AES, such as the Sbox and field multiplications, and composes them 
using new variables to produce a translation with as few clauses as possible. 

This translation is only the beginning, and not, we believe, the best; finding a
good translation is a hard problem. We investigate better representations in
the OKlibrary (see IV) and consider what it means to be a good translation in a 
forthcoming technical report on attacking the AES cipher using SAT. 

A wider range of AES benchmarks based on these same translations are available 
as the "Small Advanced Encryption Standard" benchmark set for SAT2011 
competition.

  - aes_challenge.cnf is the 128-bit AES key discovery challenge.

  - MD5_Challenge contains the md5 hash values of the AES challenge.

III Instance

The instance is 19211831 bytes and should be *excessively hard* for any solver to solve.

Instance statistics
  - first row: number of variables, number of clauses, number of literal
    occurrences
  - then the occurring clause-lengths and the number of clauses of that length

IV The OKlibrary http://www.ok-sat-library.org

All developments took place within the OKlibrary, an open-source research
platform around the SAT problem. Also the translation framework used to
generate the instance is provided there, as well as a more general set of
benchmarks with reduced variants of the AES.

List of relevant directories in OKplatform/OKsystem/OKlib (where OKplatform
is the directory of the unpacked OKlibrary-package):

 - Experimentation/Benchmarks: all our benchmark packages (typically without
   the instances)
 - Experimentation/Investigations/Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard: all
   current investigations into AES
 - ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/CryptoSystems/Rijndael/: an AES 
   implementation in the Maxima computer algebra system
 - ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/: the AES 
   translation in the Maxima computer algebra system

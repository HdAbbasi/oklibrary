VI Description

GreenTao_2-k1-k2_n.cnf, where k1,k2,n are natural numbers, k1 <= k2,
is generated by

./GTSat k1 k2 n

and is the following clause-set F:

 Variables are 1, ..., n.
 The meaning of variable i is the i-th prime number p_i (p_1=2,p_2=3,...).

 We have (only) positive and negative clauses, where the positive
 clauses belong to k1, the negative to k2.

 The positive clauses are the arithmetic progressions of length k1
 in {p_1, ..., p_n}.
 The negative clauses are the arithmetic progressions of length k2
 in {p_1, ..., p_n}.

 An arithmetic progression of length k is a sequence a, a+d, ..., a+(k-1)d
 for natural numbers a, d (both >= 1).


VII Example

SAT2011_GreenTao> GTSat 3 4 9
Created GreenTao_2-3-4_9.cnf.
SAT2011_GreenTao> cat GreenTao_2-3-4_9.cnf
c Green-Tao problem with two colours, where k1 = 3, k2 = 4, and n = 9.
p cnf 9 8
2 3 4 0
2 4 5 0
3 5 7 0
2 5 8 0
4 6 8 0
2 6 9 0
5 7 9 0
-3 -5 -7 -9 0

The meaning of the nine variables is

1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 5
4 -> 7
5 -> 11
6 -> 13
7 -> 17
8 -> 19
9 -> 23

For example the clause {2,3,4} stands for the arithmetic progression {3,5,7},
{4,6,8} stands for {7,13,19}, and {-3,-5,-7,-9} stands for {5,11,17,23}.


VIII Green-Tao numbers

The theorem of Green-Tao implies that for all k1, k2 there exists a natural
number grt_2(k1,k2) such that
 - for n < grt_2(k1,k2) the instance GreenTao_2-k1-k2_n.cnf is satisfiable
 - for n >= grt_2(k1,k2) the instance GreenTao_2-k1-k2_n.cnf is unsatisfiable.

The known bounds are astronomical (more than 10-times exponential), and of
no practical use.

For example grt_2(3,5) = 528.


IX On the choice of instances

The instances belong to the known or conjectured 2-coloured Green-Tao numbers.

In \cite{Kullmann2010GreenTao} also more than 2 colours are considered,
which yield non-boolean clause-sets, for which via the generic translation
from \cite{Kullmann2010GreenTao} there are many possibilities for boolean
translations.


X The OKlibrary http://www.ok-sat-library.org

All developments took place within the OKlibrary, an open-source research
platform around the SAT problem. Also the source-code of the generator (also
for more than 2 colours) is provided there.

List of relevant directories in OKplatform/OKsystem/OKlib (where OKplatform
is the directory of the unpacked OKlibrary-package):

 - Experimentation/Benchmarks: all our benchmark packages (typically without
   the instances)
 - Experimentation/Investigations/RamseyTheory/GreenTaoProblems: all current
   investigations into Green-Tao numbers (and related problems)
 - Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators: the generators (C++ programs and
   wrapper scripts)
 - ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/RamseyTheory: the SAT
   generators at the Maxima-level (a general computer-algebra system)
 - ComputerAlgebra/RamseyTheory/Lisp/GreenTao: the Green-Tao numbers and
   other (mathematical or algorithmic) concepts (at Maxima-level).

The OKlibrary-internal documentation for the SAT2011-benchmarks is provided at

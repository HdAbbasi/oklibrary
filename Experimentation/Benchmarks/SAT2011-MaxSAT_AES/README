II Advanced Encryption Standard component benchmarks

We provide translations of CNF minimisation problems for boolean functions,
given by components of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and small scale
variants. Optimal solutions to these benchmarks correspond to minimum size 
CNF representations for the AES Sbox and field multiplications.


III Background

In a forthcoming technical report, we investigate different translations of
AES into SAT. We provide instances of the AES key discovery problem, using
one such translation, which we call "the minimum box translation", to generate
benchmarks for the main track of SAT2011. This translation uses CNF 
representations of minimum size of the components of the AES, with the aim of
producing a translation with as few clauses as possible. Finding such minimum 
CNF representations for these boxes is the problem presented by the set of 
benchmarks discussed here.

Using such minimum representations is a natural starting point. We investigate
other representations in the OKlibrary (see VII), and consider what
constitutes a good translation in a forthcoming technical report on attacking
the AES cipher using SAT:

@TechReport{GwynneKullmann2011AES,
  author =       {Matthew Gwynne and Oliver Kullmann},
  title =        {Attacking {AES} via {SAT}: Constraints and boolean functions},
  institution =  {arXiv},
  year =         2011,
  number =       {arXiv:??? [cs.DM]},
  month =        {April},
  annote =       {In preparation.}
}

Additional to this benchmark set, we separately provide:

- Advanced Encryption Standard I benchmarks          (SAT2011 - main track)
    Key discovery problem instances for AES and small scale variants of AES.
- "The AES challenge" benchmark                      (SAT2011 - main track)
    A full AES instance with an unknown key: a challenge to the SAT community.
- Advanced Encryption Standard component benchmarks  (SAT2011 - PseudoBoolean)
    Minimisation problems for the AES component functions, as provided in 
    this benchmark, but using a translation into pseudo-boolean problems.


IV Instances

  - with size in bytes
  - "e" for easy, "h" for hard, "vh" for very hard.

In Benchmarks:

11102     sbox_4.wcnf    (e)
366673984 sbox_8.wcnf    (vh)
11386697  mul_8_3.wcnf   (h)
17386969  mul_8_9.wcnf   (h)
28060140  mul_8_11.wcnf  (h)
28011516  mul_8_13.wcnf  (h)
26610816  mul_8_14.wcnf  (h)

The only known optimum solution is for sbox_4.wcnf. It's minimum sum of weights for the falsified clauses is 22. All instances are weighted MaxSAT problems. 

V The Advanced Encryption Standard components

We provide translations of the problem of finding a CNF of minimum size
representing the:

- 4-bit small scale AES Sbox.
- 8-bit AES Sbox.
- 8-bit AES multiplication by 03.
- 8-bit AES multiplication by 09.
- 8-bit AES multiplication by 11.
- 8-bit AES multiplication by 13.
- 8-bit AES multiplication by 14.

Consider the 8-bit Sbox boolean function f, and the:

  - Clauses D in the full CNF F of f.
  - Prime implicates C in PI(F) of f.

We then construct the CNF SHG(F) with:

  - A variable for every prime implicate C in PI(F).
  - A clause for every D specifying some C subsumes it.

A satisfying assignment for SHG(F) corresponds to a CNF F'. F' contains prime implicates corresponding to variables set to true. 

Consider a satisfying assignment with the minimum number of ones. This assignment corresponds to a minimum size CNF F' subset PI(F). That is, F' is a minimum sized CNF representation for f.

We construct a weighted MaxSAT instance with:

  - The variable set V(F).
  - The clauses of SHG(F) with weight |V(F)|+1.
  - Unit clauses {-v} with weight 1 for every v in V(F).

The underlying clause-set is then unsatisfiable, whereas SHG(F) is satisfiable. Observe that an assignment phi with maximum weight has that:

  - phi satisfies all clauses in SHG(F), as |V(F)|+1 > |V(F)|.
  - phi minimises the number of variables set to true.

Therefore, such maximum weight assignments correspond to minimum sized CNFs.

VI On the choice of instances

The Advanced Encryption Standard is widely used and well studied. Analysis of these core functions will yield new translations of AES. These translations should offer insights into the cryptographic properties of AES.

The 8-bit components come directly from the AES. They represent hard optimisation benchmarks of practical importance. The 4-bit component offers a feasible, novel and non-trivial benchmark.

VII The OKlibrary http://www.ok-sat-library.org

All developments took place within the OKlibrary, an open-source research
platform around the SAT problem. Also the translation framework used to
generate the translations of the AES cipher is provided there.

is the directory of the unpacked OKlibrary-package):

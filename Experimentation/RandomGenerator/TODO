Oliver Kullmann, 1.3.2002

Basically the package seems alright to me, only the following three
measures should be taken in the future to further polish the "product":

1) Really ensuring the correctness of the implementation for all possible
   sizes of "bytes" and integer types

The implementation should already now be correct, when compiled with
any ISO 14882 compliant compiler on any hardware (in fact, there should be 
no "exotic" requirements).

However, I didn't check this in each case, so at present
when a byte contains more than 8 bits, or a 32 bit integer type is not
found, then a compiler error is produced.

For the next version of OKgenerator, this security measure shall be
no longer necessary.

2) Improving running times

The implementation of aes seems to be fairly efficient, but the use
of the library "flint" in the literal generator (for calculations with
large integer numbers) seems to be the bottleneck, where something could
be done.

3) Admitting arbitrarily large numbers within the handling of densities

At present the underlying (unsigned integer) numbers for representing
decimal fractions and rational numbers are restricted to 16 * 2 = 32
byte numbers. This should be enough for all practical purposes, but
nevertheless the possibility of an overflow creates a somehow bad
feeling (at least for me), and thus in the future arbitrary precision
is sought.

-------------

Finally also further tools for convenient use of OKgenerator will be provided
(preparing an experiment, processing an experiment, transferring the results
from an experiment to the database, communication with the database).

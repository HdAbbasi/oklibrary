  \brief Plans for the module concerning the formulas-database


  \todo Documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Add minimal doxygen-documentation to the C++ files. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo make
  <ul>
   <li> Shall we use the local postgresql-installation for compilation
   (as include-source)? Perhaps as the default. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Other files
  <ul>
   <li> How to treat the .dtd and .sql files? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Transfer:
  First the old module is transferred to the OKlibrary, and then
  it is extended. DONE (transferred; extensions are to be planned)


  \todo OKgenerator: DONE
  Connect to the module RandomGenerator (see RandomGenerator/plans/RandomGenerator.hpp), and to the old module OKsolver/Generator.
  This should concern mostly the tools for experiment-processing etc.
  Likely all those programs should be transferred to this module.


  \todo Renaming: DONE
  Once we can do directory-renaming with the version control system, this
  module should be renamed; possibilities:
  - OKdatabase
  - Database

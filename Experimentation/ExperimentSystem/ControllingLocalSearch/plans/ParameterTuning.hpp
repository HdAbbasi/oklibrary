  \brief %Tools for tuning local search algorithms

  Especially we consider running Ubcsat, while tools are often written in R.


  \todo Selecting the best parameters
  <ul>
   <li> Given a single algorithm, tuning of the parameters such as "cutoff",
   "runs" etc might yield better results for certain problem classes. </li>
   <li> As in
   ExperimentSystem/ControllingLocalSearch/plans/AlgorithmSelection.hpp,
   testing parameters by hand first is best and then trying to automatise
   the process. </li>
  </ul>

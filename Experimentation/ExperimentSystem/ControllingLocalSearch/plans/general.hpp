  \brief %Tools for running and evaluating local search algorithms

  Especially we consider running Ubcsat, and tools for evaluation
  are to be written in R.


  \todo Create milestones
  <ul>
   <li> This is now urgently needed (also quite something has been
   established). </li>
   <li> The current version should be 0.2 (some tools have been established).
   </li>
   <li> For 0.3 concentration on finishing run_ubcsat and related evaluation
   tools. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Meta heuristics
  <ul>
   <li> See "Faster local search" in
   Experimentation/Investigations/RamseyTheory/GreenTaoProblems/plans/general.hpp
   for first plans. </li>
  </ul>

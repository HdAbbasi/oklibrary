  \brief General plans monitoring Minisat2


  \bug ??? THIS MAKES NO SENSE (self-reference) ???
  Bad specifications and documentation
  <ul>
   <li> See comments in SolverMonitoring/plans/Minisat2.hpp, marked by "???".
   </li>
   <li> The same also applies at other places. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Improving read_minisat_output
  <ul>
   <li> The simplification time is missing. </li>
   <li> The column-names are too long; planning is needed, and standardisation,
   if possible, with the other extraction-tools. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Move read_minisat2_output functionality to wrapper script
  <ul>
   <li> See "Move read_picosat_output functionality to wrapper script"
   in SolverMonitoring/plans/Picosat.hpp. </li>
  </ul>

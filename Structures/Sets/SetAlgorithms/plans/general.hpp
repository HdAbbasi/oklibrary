  \brief Plans for the module on sets-related algorithms and datastructures


  \todo Update namespace


  \todo Update namespace-usage


  \todo Update doxygen-documentation


  \todo Update plans, transfer todos


  \todo Reorganisation
  <ul>
   <li> "Sets" is also in the supermodule-name, so should be removed from
   the module-name. </li>
   <li> Perhaps we should have a module with basic set operations (like
   union and intersection), and another one with subsumption. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo New test system


  \todo Write docus.


  \todo Write demos.

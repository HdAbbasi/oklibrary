  \brief Plans for the module containing old OKsolver-etc-code


  \todo Submodule "Experimental":
   - "AllgKlassen" : All content should be transferred
     (that is, what is still relevant).
   - "Graphen" : It seems there is nothing of real interest in here anymore.
   - "Transformationen" : All content should be transferred
     (that is, what is still relevant).
   After completed transfer, module should be removed.


  \todo Submodule "Generator" must be transferred to module RandomGenerator.


  \todo Submodule "Hilfsprogramme" should be inspected, what the compilation-tool there
   is doing, so that interesting functions can be incorporated into the build system.


  \todo Submodule "Quellen" should be transferred to module OKsolver_1_0.


  \todo Submodule "Datenbank" has been transferred to module OKdatabase,
  and should sooner or later be removed. DONE

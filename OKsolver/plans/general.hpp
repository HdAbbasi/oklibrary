  <ul>
   <li> "AllgKlassen" : All content should be transferred </li>
   <li> After completed transfer, module should be removed. </li>

     (that is, what is still relevant). DONE (moved to
     Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators)
   </li>
   <li> "Graphen" : It seems there is nothing of real interest in here anymore.
     DONE (transferred to Combinatorics/Graphs/BoostSupport)
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Submodule "Generator" must be transferred to module RandomGenerator. DONE


  \todo Submodule "Hilfsprogramme" should be inspected, what the compilation-tool there
   is doing, so that interesting functions can be incorporated into the build system.
   DONE (transferred to module Satisfiability/Solvers/OKsolver)


  \todo Submodule "Quellen" should be transferred to module OKsolver_1_0. DONE
  (moved to module Satisfiability/Solvers/OKsolver)


  \todo Submodule "Datenbank" has been transferred to module OKdatabase,

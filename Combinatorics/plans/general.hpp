  \brief Plans for the combinatorics module

  In this part, direct algorithms for combinatorial
  problems are developed, while their solution as
  application of (generalised) satisfiability
  might go to part Satisfiability (if general enough) or
  to part Applications.


  \todo Update namespaces.

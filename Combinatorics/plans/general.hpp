  \brief Plans for the combinatorics module

  In this part, direct algorithms for combinatorial
  problems are developed, while their solution as
  application of (generalised) satisfiability
  might go to part Satisfiability (if general enough) or
  to part Applications.


  \todo Combinatorial matrices
  <ul>
   <li> It seems that this subject belongs to this part, and
   not to "Structures/Algebra" ? </li>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/CombinatorialMatrices/plans/general.hpp for
   combinatorial matrices in computer algebra. </li>
   <li> An important topic is isomorphism of combinatorial matrices. </li>

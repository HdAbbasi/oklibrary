  \brief Plans for the sub-module on graph-traversal


  \todo Implement the generic graph_traversal algorithm from
  the CS-232 script (generic enough, and with enough event-points,
  so that protocolling and visualisation are possible).


  \todo Graph traversal is a basic technique for all forms of
  applications of graph theory to SAT; a general overview on
  algorithms and implementations is needed, and also on overview
  on the potential applications.

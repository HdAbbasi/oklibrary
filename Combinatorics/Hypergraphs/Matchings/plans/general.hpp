  \brief Plans regarding disjoint hyperedge sets in hypergraphs


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Relations
  <ul>
   <li> The dual notion is that of vertex sets such that no hyperedge
   exists which contains two of them; explore this notion (compare
   "strong independence" in Hypergraphs/IndependentSets/plans/general.hpp). </li>
   <li> The special graph-case is treated in Graphs/Matchings/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>

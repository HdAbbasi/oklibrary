  \brief Plans regarding independent (vertex) sets in hypergraphs


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Relations
  <ul>
   <li> The complementary notion is that of a transversal (see
   Hypergraphs/Transversals/plans/general.hpp); clarify the relations. </li>
   <li> The dual notion is that of sets of hyperedges such that for no
   vertex all occurrences are covered; explore this notion. </li>
   <li> The notion of "strong independence", that is, independent vertex sets
   in the 2-section (see Graphs/IndependentSets/plans/general.hpp), perhaps
   should go to its own module? Definitely the formation of k-sections should
   go into its own module. </li>
   <li> The special case for graphs is treated in
   Combinatorics/Graphs/IndependentSets/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Hypergraphs/Lisp/plans/general.hpp (especially
   "ind_hyp"). </li>
  </ul>

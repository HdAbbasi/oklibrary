  \brief Implementations of enumerations of hypergraph
  transversals based on the direct method.


  \todo Concepts
  <ul>
   <li> Creating the concepts (the output, the transversal
   hypergraph, as container; for incrementell methods the
   iterator in it creates the next transversal "on the fly"). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo %Implementation
  <ul>
   <li> The general implementation as discussed in AllSolutions/plans/MinimalAssignments.hpp
   ("The basic algorithm") should be generic enough to obtain the
   hypergraph case as a special case. </li>
   <li> Worth having a dedicated hypergraph-implementation? </li>
  </ul>

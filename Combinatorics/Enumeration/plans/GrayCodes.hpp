  \brief %Tools to enumerate combinations, that is all elements of
  A_1 x ... x A_n for finite linearly ordered sets A_i, in the order given by Gray codes.


  \todo Write an iterator (at least a forward iterator) that, after initialising
  the A_i in appropriate forms (as a sequence of ranges, or simpler by a
  sequence of natural numbers (the sizes of the A_i)), iterates through
  the code-words for example by representing elements by pairs (i, j) of iterators, where i points
  to the sequence A_i, while j points to the element of A_i (or simply
  by pairs (i, j) of indices). More efficient would be to use a vector of length
  n of iterators, each iterator at position i pointing into A_i.
   - But it should also be possible to run directly
     through all vectors of length n with respective entries from A_i, so that
     for example we can run through all binary code words of length n.
   - One should have special implementations for the special (though 
     "representative") case of A_i = {0, ..., k_i}. Having the possibility of enumerating 
     all those combinations, using the entries as indices we can also solve the general
     problem; the general solution, not using indices, would save the user
     the step of putting things into vectors first, and dereferencing indices all
     the time, but of course the general solution introduces its own complexities.
   - In the case of binary codes (all |A_i| = 2) in principal it suffices to tell
     the next position of a flip (in the general situation I assume that telling the
     next position where a cyclic movement occurs is sufficient). It should be possible
     to obtain this information also when the iterator directly does the flip.


  \todo The first problem is to determine an algorithm, generalising algorithms
  for binary Gray codes (using the Hamming distance on A_1 x ... x A_n).
  \todo An efficiency problem occurs, when for example we want to enumerate
  all total assignments for a problem instance, and then doubling of the
  code word representation occurs: For the application algorithm we likely need
  our own data structures for total assignments, while the iterator also needs
  an internal representation of the current code word. Best, if in such situations
  the iterator could use here the total assignment (instead of its own representation).
  The general problem here is, that we might want to enumerate objects with some
  structure.

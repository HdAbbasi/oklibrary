  \brief Plans for the module regarding tree decompositions
  \todo First we should look out for existing implementations,
  and, if possible, integrate them into the library.
  \todo Furthermore we must obtain an overview on algorithms
  from the literature and we should make a plan for our own
  generic implementations.

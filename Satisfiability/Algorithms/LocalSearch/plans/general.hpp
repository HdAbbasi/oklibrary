    <ul>
     <li> how to use the binary </li>
     <li> how to use the library files </li>
     <li> what are those library files </li>
     <li> how to use LocalSearch/Ubcsat. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Get rid off the temporary build-directory by adding
   \code
-I- -I$(OKsystem)/Transitional/LocalSearch/Ubcsat/corrected
   \endcode
   to the build-compilation. (?) </li>
  </ol>


  \todo Contact the developers of Ubcsat
  <ul>

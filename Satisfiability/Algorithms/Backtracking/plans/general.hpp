  \brief General plans on generic backtracking algorithms, their concepts and
  implementations.


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Move the content of Transitional/SATAlgorithms here.


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Update Satisfiability/Algorithms/Backtracking/DLL_Algorithms.cpp, so that it becomes
  a very simple implementation of the generic concepts.

  \brief Plans for the module on autarky search


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Update plans
  <ul>
   <li> Is this sub-module only for "direct" search for autarkies,
   while the algorithms performing iterated SAT-search with
   variable-cross-out (see [Kullmann, Lynce, Marques-Silva 2006])
   goes to a different module? </li>
   <li> Should we make an organisation difference between full
   autarky search and partial autarky search? </li>
  </ul>

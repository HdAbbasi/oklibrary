  \brief Plans on the supermodule on SAT algorithms in general

  General algorithms, complete and incomplete ones, for (generalised)
  SAT solving.
  

  \todo DONE (created ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/BoundedDeficiency/plans/general.hpp)
  Create module for SAT problems with bounded maximal deficiency.


  \todo Create module for solving small SAT problems : DONE
  (moved to Satisfiability/Heuristics/plans/general.hpp)


  \todo Update namespaces : DONE


  \todo Create milestones : DONE

  \brief Plans for the development of components for variations on (generalised) SAT


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Create module on NaeSat.


  \todo Create module on XSat.


  \todo Module on counting
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps here we should have a sub-module Counting? </li>
   <li> There we should implement the algorithm for approximating
   the number of falsifying assignments by sampling. </li>
   <li> Of course, counting algorithms are also obtained by representing
   all solutions, which is under AllSolutions/plans/general.hpp ? </li>
   <li> We need to find a clear structure where to place what. </li>
  </ul>

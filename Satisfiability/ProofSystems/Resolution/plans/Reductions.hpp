  \brief Plans for resolution reductions

  Here we handle reductions which have to do with adding resolvents,
  while the partial-assignment based approaches are handled in module
  FailedLiteralReduction (see plans/FailedLiteralReduction.hpp) and,
  for the general case, in module KLevelForcedAssignments (see
  plans/KLevelForcedAssignments.hpp).

  \todo Implement the reductions from the Kullmann/Luckhardt-preprints.

  \todo Implement bounded resolution.

  \todo All kinds of binary-clause reasoning are handled by module
  FailedLiteralReduction, or?

# Processing of a directory produced by SplitViaOKsolver.
# Two modes of usage:

# ProcessiSplitViaOKsolver iCNF-file

# creates the experiment-directory "Process_filename_timestamp"
# (in the current directory) containing the files
#  - Log: general logging information
#  - Parameter: the version of this script, the splitviaoksolver-directory,
#     the created experiment-directory, and the solver used
#  - Environment: information on the computer environment
#  - current_subinstance: starting with 1, the index of the next sub-instance
#    to be solved
#  - SubinstanceStatistics: in R-format the collected data
#  - If a satisfiable sub-instance was found, then in file
#    SatisfyingAssignments for each satisfiable sub-instance one has a line
#    "index original-index" with the index for this processing and the index
#    w.r.t. the original creation by OKsolver.
#  - Upon completion, the file Result is created which contains whether
#    the instance was determined satisfiable or unsatisfiable, and the total
#    running time (the sum of process times for all processes involved).
# Furthermore Temp.cnf contains the instance (after application of the
# partial assignment) currently solved, and Temp.out contains the solver
# output of the last solved instance.

# ProcessiSplitViaOKsolver iCNF-file Process_dir

# uses the already created Process_dir (created by a previous invocation
# of that script) to continue an interrupted processing.
# (Currently no un-interruptible parts are declared, but it seems practically
# save to interrupt and restart a process. For the final running time, as
# stored in Result, currently only the last run is used.)

# Currently usage of minisat-2.2.0 is hardcoded.

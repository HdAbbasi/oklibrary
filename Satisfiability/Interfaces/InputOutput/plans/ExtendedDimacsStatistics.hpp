  \brief Plans on the application extracting statistics from files in (extended) Dimacs format


  \todo Better output
  <ul>
   <li> The output description should be more descriptive. </li>
   <li> Also the maximal index and the real number of variables is needed.
   </li>
   <li> And via a command-line parameter "raw output" (just the numbers,
   separated by spaces) are output. </li>
   <li> Likely Messages should be used. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo More convenient input
  <ul>
   <li> We should provide some standard parameters ("--help" etc.). </li>
   <li> Perhaps also something like "--file=", where then the input
   comes from a file. </li>
  </ul>

  \file Interfaces/InputOutput/plans/general.hpp
  \brief Plans for the module on SAT-related input/output.


  \todo Elementary file-surgery
  <ul>
   <li> For adapting a single Dimacs-file we have
   InputOutput/ExtendedToStrictDimacs.cpp (see
   Interfaces/InputOutput/plans/ExtendedToStrictDimacs.hpp). </li>
   <li> Appending files:
    <ol>
     <li> We need a script
     \verbatim
AppendDimacs file_1 ... file_n
     \endverbatim
     which creates a new comment "Append current-date file_1 ... file_n:",
     followed by the comments from the files in the given order (each with
     heading "File filename"), then the parameter line "p n c", where n is the
     maximum of the n-values of file_i, while c is the sum of c-values of
     file_i, and finally the clauses from file_1, ..., file_n (of course,
     without the comment- and parameter-lines). </li>
     <li> An awk-script should do the job (we just need to filter lines, and
     to compute the sum and the maximum). </li>
     <li> Two passes over all files are used, but for the first pass each
     file-reading is aborted as soon as the parameter-line was read. </li>
     <li> So the first pass just computes the new n and c, and copies the
     comments to standard output. </li>
     <li> In the second pass then first the new parameter-line is output, and
     then all lines after the parameter-line in files file_1, ..., file_n are
     copied to the output. </li>
     <li> There is also the possibility, that some of the file_i do not contain
     a parameter-line, in which case the maximum n and the clause-count c
     for this file is also to be computed in the first pass. </li>
     <li> Computing c can just be done by counting the number of occurrences
     of " 0", while for computing n the maximum of the absolute values of
     numbers read is to be computed. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Rewrite code for the new namespaces.


  \todo Update
  <ul>
   <li> Get an overview on the current state of the module, create new
   plans-files for the sub-modules, move the todo's to there, update
   the doxygen-documentation. </li>
   <li> Especially docus and example-applications are needed! </li>
   <li> Files involved:
    <ol>
     <li> InputOutput/ClauseSetAdaptors.hpp : </li>
     <li> InputOutput/Exceptions.hpp : </li>
     <li> InputOutput/ExtendedDimacsStatistics.cpp : </li>
     <li> InputOutput/ExtendedToStrictDimacs.cpp : DONE </li>
     <li> InputOutput/Dimacs.hpp : DONE </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Update milestones. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo See OKlib/Satisfiability/ProofSystems/DPv/Input_output.hpp


  \todo Write docus
  <ul>
   <li> First task: How to create Dimacs-output.
    <ol>
     <li> The class template InputOutput::CLSAdaptorDIMACSOutput, a model of
     concept CLSAdaptor, is the main component. </li>
     <li> The idea of such a CLSAdaptor is, that it provides event-handlers
     for registering clauses etc., and delivers the collected information
     to another component, in edited form. </li>
     <li> If the clause-set F to be output is given as a sequence of
     sequences, then class template InputOutput::ListTransfer is the component
     to be plugged into a CLSAdaptor; in this case, where we just want to
     output it, this is CLSAdaptorDIMACSOutput. </li>
     <li> As a convenience instantiation, InputOutput::List2DIMACSOutput is
     provided, which can be used by
     \code
InputOutput::List2DIMACSOutput(F, out, comment)
     \endcode
     for an ostream "out" and an optional string "comment". </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Interfaces/InputOutput/ClauseSetAdaptors.hpp provides various
   adaptors, for transfer into some data-structure, or directly to output,
   or just counting. </li>
   <li> While Interfaces/InputOutput/Dimacs.hpp yields basically components
   which take a CLS-adaptor as template parameter, and supply it with the
   input from some source in DIMACS format. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Move to the new test system.


  \todo Complete the tests.


  \todo Write demos.


  \todo Complete the functionality.


  \todo Input and output of partial assignments.


  \todo Input and output of propositional formulas
  <ul>
   <li> Formats:
    <ol>
     <li> Edimacs format: http://www.satcompetition.org/2005/edimacs.pdf </li>
     <li> ISCAS ??? </li>
     <li> AIGER http://fmv.jku.at/aiger/ ? </li>
     <li> Maxima terms
      <ol>
       <li> See
       ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/PropositionalLogic/plans/Formulas.hpp
       for the representation of propositional logic at Maxima/Lisp level.
       </li>
       <li> Writing these terms to files such that Maxima can directly read
       them yields a system for representing propositional formulas. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Strictly bracketed "~,&,|,<->,->"-formulas
      <ul>
       <li> Identifiers use letters a-z,A_Z, digits 0-9 and
       underscores. </li>
       <li> Binary operators "&,|,<->,->" have at least one space
       left and right, and terms are enclosed in brackets: "(a op b)". </li>
       <li> Negation terms don't need brackets, i.e., they have the form
       "~Term" (possibly with space symbols after "~"), where Term is either
       "Identifier" or "(a op b)". </li>
       <li> Constants are "true" and "false". </li>
       <li> Except of these rules, space symbols can be used arbitrarily. </li>
       <li> And also additional brackets (well-formed) can be used arbitrarily.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> See "BDD's and boolean functions" in
     Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/SAT.hpp. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Benchmark collections
    <ol>
     <li> SAT 2005 ? </li>
     <li> In [Jain, Bartzis, Clarke; SAT 2006] some benchmarks are mentioned.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>   
  </ul>


  \todo Circuits
  <ul>
   <li> What systems exist to represent boolean circuits (and more general
   forms)? </li>
   <li> Likely they are similar to "Straight-line programs" as discussed in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/FiniteFunctions/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>

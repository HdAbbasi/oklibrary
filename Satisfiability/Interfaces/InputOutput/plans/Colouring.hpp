  \brief Plans regarding translating colouring problems to SAT problems


  \todo Improve design
  <ul>
   <li> In Interfaces/InputOutput/Colouring.hpp we have the two class templates
   InputOutput::HypergraphTwoColouring and
   InputOutput::GeneralisedHypergraphColouring. </li>
   <li> They follow different design approaches. </li>
   <li> Reflecting on the experiences made, possibly we should unify the
   designs. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Improve implementations
  <ul>
   <li> Transfer the todos from Interfaces/InputOutput/Colouring.hpp here.
   </li>
  </ul>

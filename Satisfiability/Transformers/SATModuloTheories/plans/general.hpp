  \brief Plans for the module SATModuloTheories.


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo First it has to be studied, how to translate these
  problems into our domain.


  \todo Difference constraints is a nice special case; see
  [Armando,Castellini,Giunchiglia,Maratea; A {SAT}-Based Decision
  Procedure for the Boolean Combination of Difference Constraints].
  For the active clause-sets the Bellman-Ford algorithm is applied.

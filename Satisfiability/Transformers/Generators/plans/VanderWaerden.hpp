  \brief Plans for generators for van der Waerden problems


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> See
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/RamseyTheory/plans/VanderWaerdenProblems.hpp
   for the fundamental (basic) specifications. </li>
   <li> See OKlib/Combinatorics/Hypergraphs/Generators/VanderWaerden.hpp
   for hypergraph generators. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update
  <ul>
   <li> See the todos in
   Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/VanderWaerden.hpp. </li>
   <li> Then also Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/VanderWaerden.hpp
   should be enhanced to produce the full ranges of instances. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Palindromic versions
  <ul>
   <li> The Maxima-specification for the boolean problems is
   output_pd_vanderwaerden2nd_stdname(k1,k2,n). </li>
  </ul>

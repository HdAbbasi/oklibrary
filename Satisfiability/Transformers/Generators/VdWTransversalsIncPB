# "VdWTransversalsIncPB k n t file1 file2" starts computing the transversal 
# number of the hypergraph of arithmetic progressions of size k over {1,...n},
# where t is the transversal number over {1,...,n-1} (thus the transversal 
# number for n is either t or t+1), and continues with n+1 and so on.
# The method is by adding the inequality "transversal size = t" to
# the clauses representing the hyperedges, obtaining a pseudo-boolean problem,
# solved then by Minisat+ (yet the only pseudo-boolean solver we have).

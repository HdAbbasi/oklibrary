# "VdWTransversalsInc k n t file" starts computing the transversal number
# of the hypergraph of arithmetic progressions of size k over {1,...n}, where
# t is the transversal number over {1,...,n-1} (thus the transversal number 
# for n is either t or t+1), and continues with n+1 and so on.
# The method is by adding the inequality "transversal size <= t" to
# the clauses representing the hyperedges, thus obtaining a SAT problem,
# solved then by Minisat (which seems to be strongest on these problems).

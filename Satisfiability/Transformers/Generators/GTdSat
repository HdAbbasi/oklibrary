# Wrapper script for creating diagonal Green-Tao SAT problems in Dimacs format,
# using the strong direct translation for non-boolean problems.

# Usage:

# GTdSat m k n

# m is the number of colours, k is the length of arithmetic progressions, while
# n is the number of vertices (i.e., prime numbers).
# The name of the output-file is "GreenTao_m-k_n.cnf".

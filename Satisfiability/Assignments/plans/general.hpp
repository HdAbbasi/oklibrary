  \file Satisfiability/Assignments/plans/general.hpp
  \brief General plans on (partial and total) assignments, their concepts and
  implementations.


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Move the related concepts and plans from Transitional/Concepts
  here.


  \todo Move Transitional/PartialAssignments here.


  \todo Improve module structure
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps we should have a sub-module "PartialAssignments", and
   PartAssign.hpp goes there. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update Satisfiability/Assignments/PartAssign.hpp, so that it becomes
  a very simple implementation of the generic concepts.

  \brief Plans regarding set-valued partial assignments


  \todo Implementation OKlib::PartialAssignments::MultiPASS
  <ul>
   <li> Reflect on the concept as discussed in Concepts/plans/PartialAssignments.hpp,
   and update accordingly. </li>
   <li> Use literals from module Literals. </li>
   <li> Perhaps instead of the <Values, Var> there should be one template parameter Literal?
   Seems sensible. </li>
   <li> The static assert should be easier to formulate (since such concept tests will be used
   at many places; is some macro already in OKlib?). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Test OKlib::PartialAssignments::MultiPASS

  \brief Plans for the development of SAT solvers in the OKlibrary

  Besides the OKsolver family, there will be other more specialised or
  experimental solvers, and interfaces to external solvers.

  A "solver" here is a special composition of components from the library,
  based on some guiding ideas.


  \todo External solvers
  <ul>
   <li> Develop first basic ideas what to do about external solvers. </li>
   <li> They are installed under ExternalSources, but at least for some
   we should enable interfacing, or simulate them (as a performance test,
   for example). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Special solvers
  <ul>
   <li> Develop a kind of conceptual framework for specialised solvers etc.
   (the areas, the directions to move). </li>
   <li> One might have solvers specialised for application areas. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update namespaces.

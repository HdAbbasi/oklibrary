  \brief Plans for the development of the OKsolver-family

  The OKsolver is meant as the general purpose SAT solver
  (at the time) realised by the OKlibrary.


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo How to refer to the different versions of OKsolver ?
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps the main name is "OKsolver2002" for the old OKsolver,
   OKsolver2008 for the new version etc. </li>
   <li> Yet we use "OKsolver_2002", but the underscore seems superfluous
   (and creates problems when writing the name). </li>
   <li> A problem then is how to call the re-programmed original
   OKsolver? </li>
   <li> Perhaps this is only an internal version, and so the name doesn't
   matter so much. </li>
   <li> So once the plans for the new OKsolver (currently "OKsolver_2_0")
   are completed, the year of it first appearance should be estimated (likely
   2008), and the module "OKsolver2008" (or else) has to be created. </li>
   <li> Perhaps then "SAT2002" should be renamed to "OKsolver2002" --- or
   perhaps we just call the modules "2002", "2008", etc., according to
   our strategy to use the full path name? </li>
   <li> Then we get a bit of a problem with the namespaces and their aliases;
   the modules could be called "Y2002", "Y2008", etc., with aliases
   "Y02", "Y08". Solvers still "OKsolver2002" etc. </li>
   <li> Should the versions appear in the name? Better not. </li>
   <li> The version of each OKsolver is the version of its module. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for the module simulating the old OKsolver


  \todo Once we are ready to start, a new sub-module is needed
  <ul>
   <li> How to name the module? </li>
   <li> If the old-OKsolver-module becomes "Y2002", then we could
   call it "Y2002_New", with alias "N02". </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update namespaces


  \todo First in computer-algebra
  <ul>
   <li> First we write the "specification" in the Lisp/Maxima-system, such
   that we obtain exactly the same counts (nodes, unit-propagations etc.)
   as in the original OKsolver. </li>
   <li> Following the general guidelines, this completely disregards
   efficiency considerations. </li>
   <li> And we do it first only for boolean clause-sets. </li>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Backtracking/OKsolver2002.mac.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Create first milestones.


  \todo Create detailed milestones until completion
  <ul>
   <li> Detailed plans are needed, with outline of concepts etc.,
   so that it needs only to be "pulled through". </li>
  </ul>

   topics are handled:
    - Update namespaces
    - How to refer to the different versions of OKsolver

  \par
   Update the following milestones. Perhaps "OKsolver/SAT2002 version 1.0"
   should be reached only in 0.6, and the steps towards this milestone
   contain more activities regarding OKsolver_1_0.hpp.


  \par Version 0.5.3

   topics are handled:
    - Once we are ready to start, a new sub-module is needed
    - Update namespaces
    - Create milestones


  \par Version 0.6

  \par OKsolver/SAT2002 version 1.0.4
  (see Solvers/OKsolver/SAT2002/plans/milestones.hpp)

  \par
   In Solvers/OKsolver/plans/OKsolver_1_0.hpp the following
   topics are handled:
    - Create detailed milestones until completion


  \par Version 1.0 : OKsolver version 1.0 (the reprogrammed and generalised
  original OKsolver) is ready


  \par Version 2.0 : OKsolver version 2.0 is ready


  \par Version 3.0 : OKsolver version 3.0 is ready



  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \par Version history

   - 0.5   : 18.8.2007; initial version number (the old OKsolver is compilable and apparently bug-free, and there is a sort of complete outline of the anticipated new solver 2.0).
   - 0.5.1 : 16.9.2007; one further bug eliminated, basic tests for old OKsolver established, and now all the main variants appear to be bug-free.

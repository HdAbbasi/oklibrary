  \par Version history

   - 0.9   : 18.8.2007; initial version number (the old OKsolver mainly unchanged since SAT2002; a bug found by Marijn Heule showed up with newer versions of gcc)
   - 0.9.1 : 20.8.2007; two bugs corrected, linking behaviour corrected, basic code maintenance performed, and basic application tests written and executed. The OKsolver in the standard version appears now to be bug-free.
   - 0.9.2 : 14.9.2007; basic tests for main variants established. Now also the main variants appear to be bug-free.

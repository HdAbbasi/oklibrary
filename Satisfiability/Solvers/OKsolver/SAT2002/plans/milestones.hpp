  \par
   Improved usability.


  \par Version 1.5

  \par
   Make nearly everything also available at the Maxima-level, and make
   sure that both levels fully coincide.


  \par Version 1.5.1

  \par
   In Solvers/OKsolver/SAT2002/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Extend statistics

    - Optimising the code


  \par Version 1.9

  \par
   The code has been optimised (w.r.t. speed; using also a profiler etc.)

  \par
   Document the extensive database-data.


  \par Version 2.0

  \par
   Now the original OKsolver is also fully reflected and fully specified.

  \par
   In Solvers/OKsolver/SAT2002/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Extension by cardinality constraints


  \par Version 2.2

  \par
   In Solvers/OKsolver/SAT2002/plans/general.hpp the following topics are handled:
    - Improved Delta(n)-distance
    - Enable finding all solutions

  \par
   Likely the above extensions should not be included in the (original)
   OKsolver-2002, but they should be moved to the generic form of
   OKsolver-2002 --- thus planning should be intensified here.



  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \par Version history

   - 0.9   : 18.8.2007; initial version number (the old OKsolver mainly unchanged since SAT2002; a bug found by Marijn Heule showed up with newer versions of gcc)
   - 0.9.1 : 20.8.2007; two bugs corrected, linking behaviour corrected, basic code maintenance performed, and basic application tests written and executed. The OKsolver in the standard version appears now to be bug-free.
   - 0.9.2 : 14.9.2007; basic tests for main variants established. Now also the main variants appear to be bug-free.
   - 0.9.3 : 22.9.2007; completed planning for counting all satisfying assignments (implementation postponed), and on the way also code and documentation maintenance.
   - 0.9.4 : 16.9.2008; various "spontaneous" workings: improved the build, extended plans, created application tests, basic code overhauls, using SIGINT instead of SIGUSR2, better documentation, corrected output of statistics.
   - 0.9.5 : 22.7.2009; extended plans, more documentation, provided combination with minisat2-preprocessor, improved timing and monitoring output.

  \brief Plans for maintaining Minisat2


  \todo Output learned clauses
  <ul>
   <li> Compare "Output of learned clauses" in
   Satisfiability/Solvers/Argosat/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> It would be useful, if we could add another option which makes
   minisat2 output (certain) learned clauses. </li>
   <li> Definitely learned unit-clauses are of interest, and perhaps in general
   one could use a size bound (with default value 1). </li>
  </ul>

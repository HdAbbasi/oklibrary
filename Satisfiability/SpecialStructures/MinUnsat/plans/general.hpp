  \brief Plans for the module on minimal unsatisfiability


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Generator-plans mentioned elsewhere and relevant here
  should move to here.


  \todo SNS-matrices, Pfaffian graphs etc. (possibly this should
  go to its own module on combinatorial autarkies?)
  <ul>
   <li> All the different formulations should be implemented
     (that is, the respective reductions). </li>
   <li> Get an overview on the existing poly-time SNS-matrix
     regocnition algorithms, and implement them. </li>
   <li> Implement the related SAT decision algorithms. </li>
   <li> Implement the related MINUNSAT-algorithms. </li>
  </ul>

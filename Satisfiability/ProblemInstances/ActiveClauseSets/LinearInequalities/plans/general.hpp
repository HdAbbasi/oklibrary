  \brief Plans for the module providing active clause-sets for linear inequalities

  Linear inequalities have constant integer coefficients; boolean values are
  interpreted as 0,1-integers.


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Transferring (and updating):
   OKsolver/Experimental/Transformationen/LinInequal.


  \todo The relations to the module InjectivityConstraints have to
  be investigated.


  \todo The relations to the module SATModuloTheory have to
  be investigated.

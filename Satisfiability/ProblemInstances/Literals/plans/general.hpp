  \file ProblemInstances/Literals/plans/general.hpp
  \brief General plans on literals, their concepts and implementations.


  \todo Update namespace-usage.


  \todo Prototypes
  <ul>
   <li> What to do with ProblemInstances/Literals/Literal.hpp ? </li>
   <li> Very first prototype for "signed literals" (set-valued literals),
   based on the basic atomic condition for arbitrary value-types. What to
   do about the requirement that the atomic condition of a literal is not
   constant? Just an invariant? </li>
   <li> It seems using "-x" for the negation of a (boolean) literal x
   is easiest. </li>
   <li> While a boolean literal x is positive iff OKlib::Literals::cond(x)
   is true. </li>
  </ul>

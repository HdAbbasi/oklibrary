  \brief General plans on literals, their concepts and
  implementations.


  \todo Update namespaces. DONE


  \todo Move module Transitional/Literals here. DONE


  \todo Move the related concepts and plans from Transitional/Concepts here.


  \todo Update namespace-usage.


  \todo Prototypes
  <ul>
   <li> What to do with ProblemInstances/Literals/Literal.hpp ? </li>
   <li> Very first prototype for "signed literals" (set-valued literals),
   based on the basic atomic condition for arbitrary value-types. What to
   do about the requirement that the atomic condition of a literal is not
   constant? Just an invariant? </li>
  </ul>

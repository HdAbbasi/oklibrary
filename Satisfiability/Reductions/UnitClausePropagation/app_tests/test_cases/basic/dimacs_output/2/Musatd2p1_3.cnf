c Saturated minimally unsatisfiable clause-set of deficiency 2 with 3 variables,
c and with added unit-clause 1.
c Additional comments regarding trivial preprocessing and unit-clause propagation:
c The original parameter were: n = 3, c = 6.
c After elimination of duplicated literals and of empty, unit and tautological clauses there are:
c 3 2-clauses, and 2 clauses of length >= 3.
c Number of unit-clauses in input = 1.
c Unit-clause propagation found a contradiction.

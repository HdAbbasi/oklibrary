  \brief Plans for the module KLevelForcedAssignments

  The special case K=2 (and extensions) is handled in module
  FailedLiteralReduction (see FailedLiteralReduction/plans/general.hpp),
  while "real" resolution reductions are handled in module Resolution
  (see Resolution/plans/Reductions.hpp). This module considers
  algorithms and data structures for the general case (arbitrary K)
  of generalised unit-clause-propagation.


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo First the scope (the (informal) concepts) has to be established.


  \todo Create milestones.

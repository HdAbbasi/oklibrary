  \brief Super-module for finite functions (especially boolean functions)

  Considered are functions f: D_1 x ... X D_n -> {0,1}, where D_i
  are finite sets (in the boolean case we have F_i = {0,1}).


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Prime implicants and implicates
  <ul>
   <li> This whole topic seems to deserve its own module (and plans-file). </li>
   <li> What terminology to use for *clause-sets*, where we could have
   CNF's or DNF (thus prime implicates or prime implicants) ? </li>
   <li> We consider the whole range of generalised clause-sets, from boolean
   clause-sets to signed clause-sets. </li>
   <li> Implicates for F are generalised clauses C which follows from F. </li>
   <li> Between generalised clauses we have the partial order "implies",
   which is quickly decidable. </li>
   <li> Prime implicates are implicates which are minimal w.r.t. to the
   partial order of implication amongst the type of generalised clauses
   considered. </li>
   <li> The algorithms which works always is to create all resolvents and
   keep the minimal ones (the "resolution algorithm").
    <ol>
     <li> See ProofSystems/Resolution/plans/ResolutionClosure.hpp. </li>
     <li> So in this module we only connect the resolution algorithm
     (which likely shouldn't care about "DNF" or "CNF") to the
     concept of finite functions. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The other main alternative is to start with a CNF or DNF (generalised)
   given, and then compute the minimal satisfying partial assignments (using
   the given literal type), which yields the prime implicates resp.
   the prime implicants (call it the "dualisation algorithm").
    <ol>
     <li> See AllSolutions/plans/MinimalAssignments.hpp. </li>
     <li> So again, likely the general algorithm is not implemented in
     this module. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> A special situation is given when we start with the full table,
   that is, with all full implicates and implicants given.
    <ol>
     <li> Likely this module is the right place for this specialisation. </li>
     <li> For the boolean case the algorithm derived fromt the general
     resolution algorithm together with some obvious simplications regarding
     subsumption-elimination is called the "Quine-McClusky algorithm". </li>
     <li> Actually, the algorithm only needs either all full implicates
     (for the prime implicates) or all full implicants (for the prime
     implicants), and both together are only used to make the algorithm
     polynomial time (since then, e.g. in the boolean case, the input
     is of size 2^n, while a trivial essential uppper bound is 3^n). </li>
     <li> The algorithm in more detail:
      <ol>
       <li> Input is a clause-set F (either CNF or DNF). </li>
       <li> In general a "subsumption-resolution" is one resolution step where
       the resolvent subsumes at least one parent clause. A
       "2-subsumption-resolution" is where both parent clauses are subsumed
       (that is, iff both parent clauses are identical except of the clashing
       literal). </li>
       <li> Let k := n(F), F_k := F. </li>
       <li> While k > 0 do
        <ol>
         <li> F_{k-1} := all 2-subsumption-resolvents from F_k. </li>
         <li> Remove from F_k all clauses which were involved in a
         resolution. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li> The union of F_n, ..., F_0 then is the set of prime implicates (for CNF)
       resp. prime implicants (for DNF), where F_k contains the clauses of
       length k. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Correctness follows by the simple fact that when F_k is first
     computated, then it contains exactly all implicates (implicants) of
     size k. </li>
     <li> The main point for the efficient implementation is finding the
     2-subsumption-resolutions fast.
      <ul>
       <li> One could think of representing the clauses in the levels F_k
       not directly, but indirectly, how they were created. This should
       save space, and could also be more time efficient. </li>
       <li> The most promising approach seems to me (OK):
        <ol>
         <li> The underlying observation is, that a clause of length k
         has exactly k possible partners for 2-subsumption resolution. </li>
         <li> So at level k (where all clauses have length k) each clause has
         an associated vector of boolean of length k, showing whether on
         the associated variable of the clause a 2-subsumption resolution
         has been done. </li>
         <li> Now processing of level k happens by running through the list
         of clauses, for each clauses finding the available 2-subsumption
         resolution partners, performing the resolutions and entering this
         information into the vectors. </li>
         <li> The main (potential) saving lies in actively searching for
         the resolution partners, which must be supported by some appropriate
         search data structure. Either a search tree or a hash table.
          <ul>
           <li> For small n (<= 16) one can treat clauses as vectors of
           length n with entries 0,1,2, which can be hashed to a bit-vector
           of length 3^n by interpretation as a positional representation
           of a ternary number. </li>
           <li> This vector for n = 16 has 3^16 / 8 = 5380840 bytes, and
           initialising this data structure once shouldn't be a problem
           (setting the bits for existing clauses to 1, others to 0).
           (The hash map could be implemented via template
           metaprogramming.) </li>
           <li> For n=20 we need 436 MB; best to use a macro, with
           default value 18 (48 MB), for the maximal n where such a hash
           table is to be used. </li>
           <li> This hash map can also be used for computing the prime
           implicates via the resolution method in general, however
           since it doesn't solve the subsumption problem it is perhaps
           less useful. </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li> Perhaps one could also use the 2-subsumption resolution graph,
         where the edges are labelled with the resolution variables. </li>
         <li> The vectors saves a factor of 2 (possibly more, since the
         resolvent needs not to be considered for the next level) due to
         not attempting the second time a resolution. When using the
         above hash table, then perhaps it is not worth the effort. </li>
         <li> Further savings could be achieved by more generally not
         attempting resolution steps where the resolvent has already
         been obtained. </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Is there a way of using both the satisfying and the falsifying
     total assignments? Likely the way to do is to combine the resolution
     algorithm with the dualisation algorithm. </li>
     <li> Can the Quine/McClusky-algorithm be generalised from boolean
     clause-sets to more general forms of clause-sets?
      <ol>
       <li> For clause-sets with non-boolean variables it should be the
       similar (only that for a variable of domain size m then m parent
       clauses are needed). </li>
       <li> Questionable for general signed clause-sets. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Minimisation


  \todo BDDs
  <ul>
   <li> In general, the decision diagrams are no longer "binare".
   Perhaps it's called "FDD" ("finite decision diagram") ? </li>
  </ul>

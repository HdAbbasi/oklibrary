  \brief General plans about implementations for bounded arithmetic


  \todo Update namespaces.

  
  \todo Scope discussion
  <ul>
   <li> It seems that one main goal is, given a proof in
   bounded arithmetic, extract a program. </li>
   <li> Which systems of bounded arithmetic to cover? </li>
   <li> Which language to use (which elementary operations etc.) ? </li>
   <li> Also proof search seems to be of interest. </li>
   <li> Do we find useful automated theorem proving tools ?
   (see Logic/AutomatedTheoremProving/plans/general.hpp) </li>
  </ul>

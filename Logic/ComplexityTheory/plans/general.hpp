  \brief Plans for the module on complexity theoretical constructions


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Module Computability
  <ul>
   <li> Connect to the development of Turing machines
   (see Logic/Computability/plans/general.hpp). </li>
   <li> Connect to the developments of Circuit models
   (see Logic/Computability/plans/general.hpp). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo NP-completeness:
  Implement the construction of SAT problems from
  the NP-completeness proof of SAT (see for example
  [Complexity and Cryptography: An Introduction; John Talbot and
  Dominic Welsh; 2006], Theorem 3.10): Given a Turing machine M and
  natural numbers n and t, construct F_M(n,t) which is satisfiable iff
  there exists an input x of size n such that M accepts x, and this
  in at most t steps. Perhaps this should go to module Computability?


  \todo NP-completeness 2:
  Implement the construction of circuits from Turing machines
  as in [Complexity and Cryptography: An Introduction; John Talbot and
  Dominic Welsh; 2006], Theorem 4.20: Given an accepting TM M
  (with outputs 0,1) and n in NN, construct a circuit C_n which
  simulates M on inputs of size n. (Translating these circuits into
  SAT problems we get an example for the above SAT-NP-completeness
  construction. On the other hand, from the CNF's constructed there
  by circuit-reconstruction we should be able to get the circuits here!)
  Perhaps this should go to module Computability?

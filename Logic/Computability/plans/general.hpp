  \brief General plans regarding computability issues


  \todo Update namespaces.

  
  \todo Turing machines
  <ul>
   <li> First we need formal grammars for the important types of
   Turing machines (there should be out there some code). </li>
   <li> Then we should (directly) simulate Turing machines. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo What else?
  <ul>
   <li> Besides Turing machines, what else is there which is related
   to (generalised) satisfiability issues (and does not fall into
   the domain of module ComplexityTheory; see ComplexityTheory/plans/general.hpp) ?
   Perhaps not much? </li>
  </ul>

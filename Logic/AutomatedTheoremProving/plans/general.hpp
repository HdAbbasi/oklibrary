  \brief General plans about automated-theorem-proving tools


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo First we need some system installed under ExternalSources.
  <ul>
   <li> Which systems are "good" ? </li>
   <li> What could we do with them ? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Relations
  <ul>
   <li> What is the relation to module ProofAssistants ?
   (see LogicalReflection/ProofAssistants/plans/general.hpp) </li>
   <li> A natural "client" seems to be module BoundedArithmetic
   (see Logic/BoundedArithmetic/plans/general.hpp) ? </li>
  </ul>

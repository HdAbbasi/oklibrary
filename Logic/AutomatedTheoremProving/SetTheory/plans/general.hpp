  \brief General plans about set theory and ATP


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Plans
  <ul>
   <li> The current plan is to develop in submodule
   SetTheory/NeumannBernaysGoedel the axiomatic foundations, within
   Prover9, while other submodules contains more specific parts of
   set theory (like ordinal numbers etc.). </li>
   <li> If we are supporting different ATP-tools, then the sub-modules
   could be subdivided. But at the base-level we better focus on
   general concepts. </li>
  </ul>

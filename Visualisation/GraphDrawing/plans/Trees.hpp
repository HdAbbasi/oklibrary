  \brief Plans for drawing trees (especially search trees)


  \todo Rheingold-Tilford algorithm outline
  <ul>
   <li> See the MSc thesis of Warren Bailey (supervisor OK). </li>
   <li> Investigate colouring schemes (see discussion of OK with Mark Jones).
   </li>
   <li> The nodes are labelled with numerical vectors, and also the edges. </li>
   <li> Additionally we have also labelling strings, like branching variables
   (for the nodes) and branching literals (for the edges). </li>
  </ul>

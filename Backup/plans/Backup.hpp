  \brief Plans regarding the backup-program written by Tony Bao

  \todo What to do with this module? In principle it should be useful to have a C++
  program for the backup; the main question then is how far we investigate this code.
  The code should offer basic functionality, which can at least be considered (no higher
  design, but on the C-level it should be okay).

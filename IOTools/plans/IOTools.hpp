  \brief Plans for the deprecated module on input/output tools

  \todo Decide what to do with this module. Is it used anymore at all ?!

  \todo The motivations we had for the name convention "_Models_Definitions"
  has to be reflected.
  \todo All of IOTools_Models_Definitions.hpp should go somewhere else
  (if it is needed at all).

  \todo The motivations we had for the creation of the separate "IOTools.hpp"
  has to be reflected.

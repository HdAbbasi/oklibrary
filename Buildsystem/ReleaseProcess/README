****************************************
* Please read the following rather     
* carefully: Since the OKlibrary is an 
* "active library", you need to become 
* familiar with the innards of it.     
****************************************


Prerequisites
-------------

The following software needs to be installed:

 - Bash, version 3.00 or higher
   (check: run "bash --version")
 - GNU make, version 3.80 or higher
  (check: run "make --version")
 - gcc
  (check: run "gcc --version")
 - readline (development library).

For creation of documentation we also need:

 - the Qt library
 - Latex
 - the m4 preprocessor
   (check: "m4 --version")
 - asciidoc
   (check: "asciidoc --version")
 - xmlto
   (check: "xmlto --version")
 - Flex 
   (check: "flex --version")
 - Bison
   (check: "bison --version").

And for pulling from a git repository via the http protocol we need

 - the curl development libraries.

Any recent Linux distribution supplies these prerequisites.
(asciidoc can be installed through the OKlibrary by calling "oklib asciidoc"
in OKplatform/ExternalSources, provided you have the root-password.)

There are other Unix/Linux tools, which some "lean distributions"
do not include (we propose you better go with a "fat distribution"),
e.g.

 - sudo
 - dos2unix
 - mmv

And Latex should include the srcltx-package.

----------------------------------------------

System requirements:

>= 512 MB main memory

(but 1 GB is better).

Disc space:

For the full OKplatform, with some versions of gcc and Boost installed:
5 GB are fully sufficient (however with only 1 GB it can get tight,
and for installing everything it is too tight).

----------------------------------------------

Building (basic setup)
----------------------

----------------------------------------------

1) In the OKplatform-directory (where this README
is placed), call

./oklib --prebuild

This creates links and directories.


2) For using the package, we need "oklib" on your path (or otherwise you
   have to call it always with its full path):

 - One symbolic link is already planted in the base directory OKplatform
   (you have used that in Step 1)), but this is only for the purpose of setting 
   up the OKlibrary, and is otherwise of restricted use.

 - The public bin-directory "OKplatform/bin" (in this directory) contains
   links to the main executables supplied by the OKlibrary, 
   including "oklib".

 - So you can put this bin-directory on your path via adding

export PATH=OKPLATFORM/bin:${PATH}

   to ~/.bashrc, where OKPLATFORM is to be replaced by the (absolute)
   path to the OKplatform-directory. In order to conveniently use
   all main programs supplied by the OKlibrary, this step is RECOMMENDED.


Once you decided on how to access "oklib" in the future, you might delete the
symbolic link in directory OKplatform.

The master script oklib should now be functional. (You can test this
by just calling "oklib --version" somewhere.)


3) Except for the minimal package, precomputed documentation is included
in the documentation (see "local home page" below).
Regarding the information on the installed external sources, this precomputed
information is not fully relevant for your system (since several test actions 
have to be performed on *your* system). To (partially) update it, use

oklib documentation_index

in directory OKsystem (or below it).

Remarks:

 - "oklib html" would fully re-install the documentation, however it needs an
   appropriate version of doxygen installed for this. See Step 4).
 - Information on installation status at the main page for "external sources"
   (directly reachable from the local home page, see below) should now
   be correct, but updating the information on the specific installation pages
   needs the full "oklib html".
 - If you get error messages with "oklib documentation_index" then likely
   this means that the binary "PathDifference" (needed to translate paths and 
   which needs to be compiled by the OKlibrary), which we supply 
   as a binary (in the optimised version), doesn't run on your system (so likely
   your system is not a i386-architecture). "oklib all" in OKsystem will compile
   it (amongst others), but you need gcc and Boost ready for this.

All necessary installations can be carried out through the OKlibrary; see
information on external sources below and on the local home page.


4) "oklib documentation_index" cannot update for examples the links in the
html-documentation to documentation of external sources. To get the 
documentation fully updated, run "oklib html" (in directory OKsystem or 
below).

For this, doxygen is needed. See how to install "external sources"
(such as doxygen) below.


----------------------------------------------

Building external sources
-------------------------

----------------------------------------------

In general, for installing an external source "extsrc", go to
directory OKplatform/ExternalSources, and call "oklib extsrc" there.

For convenience we provide "oklib all" (in ExternalSources), which
gives you a reasonable first selection. (Currently we cannot
install just everything, due to build dependencies.)


Some specific installations are as follows (all included with "oklib all",
so if this has been (successfully) executed then there is no need for further 
actions):

1) The OKlibrary provides a local installation of doxygen. 
This installation can be executed by calling "oklib doxygen" in directory 
OKplatform/ExternalSources.
After this installation is finished, "oklib html" should then run successfully
(recall, this call to "oklib" must happen in OKplatform/OKsystem (or below)).

A link to the (locally installed) doxygen is planted in the public bin-directory 
OKplatform/bin, so that you can use doxygen yourself (by just calling
"doxygen" somewhere; try "doxygen --version").

2) In order to use the version control system, we recommend to install git
via the OKlibrary, again by running "oklib git" in directory 
OKplatform/ExternalSources.

Again, after installation a link is planted in the public bin-directory 
OKplatform/bin.

Git comes with modern Linux distributions, but the OKlibrary should provide
the most suitable version (either the newest one, or in case of some trouble
an appropriate earlier version).

3) The most convenient way to install the Maxima/Lisp computer-algebra-system 
for SAT experimentation is by running "oklib allmaxima" in directory 
OKplatform/ExternalSources.

4) A local gcc is installed (providing a C and a C++ compiler).

5) The C++ libraries Boost and Mhash are installed locally (using the
local gcc).

6) The Gmp library is installed locally.

6) And further computer algebra systems installed are Gap, R and Sage.

7) Yet the only SAT solver installed by default is Ubcsat.


After having installed these tools, via

oklib all check new_check app_tests html

called in directory OKplatform/OKsystem, all executables provided
by the OKlibrary itself are built, tests are run, and finally the
documentation is updated.


----------------------------------------------

***********************************************

All further documentation is found on the local home page in

OKplatform/system_directories/doc/local_html/index.html.

(Note that for the minimal package the documentation is not pre-installed,
but has to be created by running "oklib html" (see Step 4) above).)

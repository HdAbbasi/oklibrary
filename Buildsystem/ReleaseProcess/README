****************************************
* Please read the following rather     
* carefully: Since the OKlibrary is an 
* "active library", you need to become 
* familiar with the innards of it.     
****************************************


Prerequisites
-------------

The following software needs to be installed:

 - Bash, version 3.00 or higher
   (check: run "bash --version")
 - GNU make, version 3.80 or higher
   (check: run "make --version")
 - GNU sed
   (check: run "sed --version")
 - GNU awk
   (check: run "awk --version")
 - gcc
   (check: run "gcc --version")
 - GNU texinfo 
   (check: run "makeinfo --version")
 - zip
   (check: run "zip -h")
 - GNU tar
  (check: run "tar --version")
 - GNU ranlib
  (check: run "ranlib --version")
 - perl
  (check: run "perl --version")
 - patch
  (check: run "patch --version")
 - tcsh
  (check: run "tcsh --version")

 - readline (development library).
 - glibc (development library).
 - X libraries (development libraries; needed by gnuplot).
 - postgresql development library ("postgresql-devel").
 - binutils development library ("binutils-devel"),
   version 2.19.1 or higher (check: "ld --version").

If the build-machine is a 64-bit machine, then
additionally also the 32-bit version of glibc
is needed (in order to build the local gcc).

For creation of documentation we also need:

 - the Qt library
 - Latex
 - the m4 preprocessor
   (check: "m4 --version")
 - asciidoc
   (check: "asciidoc --version")
 - xmlto
   (check: "xmlto --version")
 - Flex 
   (check: "flex --version")
 - Bison
   (check: "bison --version").

And for installing and using Git we need the following:

 - zlib
 - openssl
 - wish (as part of the Tcl/Tk system)
 - ssh
 - curl, and expat development library (for pulling/pushing from/to 
   a git repository via the http protocol).

And Latex should include the srcltx-package.

Any recent Linux distribution supplies these prerequisites.
(asciidoc can be installed through the OKlibrary by calling "oklib asciidoc"
in OKplatform/ExternalSources, provided you have the root-password.)

In general we recommend to pre-install as much as possible to minimise
build-problems (go for a "fat distribution"; especially Ubuntu is
problematic, since not much is installed by default).


----------------------------------------------

System requirements:

>= 4 GB main memory.
(though with 1 GB you will still be able to run nearly everything).

Disc space:

For the full OKplatform 10 GB are sufficient, while with only 5 GB
it can get tight, and cleaning of installed external sources is needed
directly after installing them.

----------------------------------------------

Building (basic setup)
----------------------

----------------------------------------------

1) In the OKplatform-directory (where this README
is placed), call

./oklib --prebuild

This creates links and directories.


2) For using the package, we need "oklib" on your path (or otherwise you
   have to call it always with its full path):

 - One symbolic link is already planted in the base directory OKplatform
   (you have used that in Step 1), but this is only for the purpose of 
   setting up the OKlibrary, and otherwise its use is inconvenient
   (though possible, and sufficient for all tasks).

 - The public bin-directory "OKplatform/bin" (in this directory) contains
   links to the main executables supplied by the OKlibrary, 
   including "oklib".

 - So you can put this bin-directory on your path via adding

export PATH=OKPLATFORM/bin:${PATH}

   to ~/.bashrc, where OKPLATFORM is to be replaced by the (absolute)
   path to the OKplatform-directory. In order to conveniently use
   all main programs supplied by the OKlibrary, this step is RECOMMENDED.


Once you decided on how to access "oklib" in the future, you might delete the
symbolic link in directory OKplatform.

The master script oklib should now be functional. (You can test this
by just calling "oklib --version" somewhere.)


3) Except for the minimal package, precomputed documentation is included
in the documentation (see "local home page" below).
Regarding the information on the installed external sources, this precomputed
information is not fully relevant for your system (since several test actions 
have to be performed on *your* system). To (partially) update it, use

oklib documentation_index

in directory OKsystem (or below it).

Remarks:

 - "oklib html" (which has documentation_index as sub-target) would fully
   re-install the documentation, however it needs an appropriate version of
   doxygen installed for this. See Step 4.
 - Information on installation status at the main page for "external sources"
   (directly reachable from the local home page, see below) should now
   be correct, but updating the information on the specific installation pages
   needs the full "oklib html".

All necessary installations can be carried out through the OKlibrary; see
information on external sources below and on the local home page.


4) "oklib documentation_index" cannot update for examples the links in the
html-documentation to documentation of external sources. To get the 
documentation fully updated, run "oklib html" (in directory OKsystem or 
below).

For this, doxygen is needed. See how to install "external sources"
(such as doxygen) below.


----------------------------------------------

Building external sources
-------------------------

----------------------------------------------

In general, for installing an external source "extsrc", go to
directory OKplatform/ExternalSources, and call "oklib extsrc" there.

For convenience we provide "oklib all" (in ExternalSources), which
gives you a reasonable first selection. (Currently we cannot
install just everything, due to build dependencies.)


Some specific installations are as follows (all included with "oklib all",
so if this has been (successfully) executed then there is no need for further 
actions):

1) A local gcc is installed (providing a C and a C++ compiler).

2) The C++ library Boost is installed locally (using the local gcc).

3) The Gmp and Mpfr libraries are installed locally.

4) The Maxima/Lisp computer-algebra-system is installed (by "oklib allmaxima",
which installs further software needed).

5) Further computer algebra systems installed are Gap, R and Sage.

6) The SAT solver installed by default are Ubcsat, minisat2, minisat-2.2.0, 
 minisat+, march_pl, satz215, survey_propagation, sat-grasp. picosat913,
 precosat236, precosat-570, the argosat solver (and library), cryptominisat,
 and glucose.
(The OKlibrary itself provides yet only OKsolver_2002_O3-DNDEBUG.)

7) The only tool installed yet for handling boolean functions is Espresso.

8) The OKlibrary provides a local installation of doxygen. 
After this installation is finished, "oklib html" should then run successfully
(recall, this call to "oklib" must happen in OKplatform/OKsystem (or below)).

A link to the (locally installed) doxygen is planted in the
public bin-directory OKplatform/bin, so that you can use doxygen yourself
(by just calling "doxygen" somewhere; try "doxygen --version").

9) In order to use the version control system, we install git (locally).

Again, after installation a link is planted in the public bin-directory 
OKplatform/bin.

Git comes with modern Linux distributions, but the OKlibrary should provide
the most suitable version (either the newest one, or in case of some trouble
an appropriate earlier version).

(In case you don't want this git replacing your system-git (which likely
happens if OKplatform/bin is on your PATH), then you can just delete that
link on OKplatform/bin (together with the other git-prefixed links).)


After having installed these tools, via

oklib all check new_check app_tests html

called in directory OKplatform/OKsystem, all executables provided
by the OKlibrary itself are built, tests are run, and finally the
documentation is updated.


----------------------------------------------

***********************************************

All further documentation is found on the local home page in

OKplatform/system_directories/doc/local_html/index.html.

(Note that for the minimal package the documentation is not pre-installed,
but has to be created by running "oklib html" (see Step 4) above).)

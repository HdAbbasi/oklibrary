# Oliver Kullmann, 15.4.2005 (Swansea)

----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites (need to be installed):

 - Bash version 3.00 or higher

 - GNU make, version 3.80 or higher
  (check: run "make -v")

 - gcc

For creation of documentation we also need:

 - the Qt library

 - Latex

Any recent Linux distribution supplies these prerequisites.

----------------------------------------------

System requirements:

>= 512 MB main memory

(but 1 GB is better).

Disc space:

For the full OKplatform, with some versions of gcc and Boost installed:
10 GB should be fully sufficient (however with only 1 GB it can get tight,
and for installing everything it is too tight).

----------------------------------------------

Building:

For using the package, we need "oklib" on your path.
One symbolic link is already planted in the base directory OKplatform.
Recommended is to set up a symbolic link in ~/bin; if you call

./oklib --setup

in directory OKplatform, then the build system will do this for you.

----------------------------------------------

All further documentation is found on the local home page in

OKplatform/system_directories/doc/local_html/index.html.

(For the minimal package, the documentation is not pre-installed,
but has to be created by running "oklib html" (which needs doxygen).)

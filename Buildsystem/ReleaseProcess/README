****************************************
* Please read the following rather     *
* carefully: Since the OKlibrary is an *
* "active library", you need to become *
* familiar with the innards of it.     *
****************************************

Prerequisites (need to be installed):

 - Bash, version 3.00 or higher
   (check: run "bash --version")
 - GNU make, version 3.80 or higher
  (check: run "make --version")
 - gcc

For creation of documentation we also need:

 - the Qt library
 - Latex
 - the m4 preprocessor.

And for pulling from a git repository via the http protocoll we need

 - the curl development libraries.

Any recent Linux distribution supplies these prerequisites.

There are other Unix/Linux tools, which some "lean distributions"
do not include (we propose you better go with a "fat distribution"),
e.g.

sudo
dos2unix
mmv

And Latex should include the srcltx-package.

----------------------------------------------

System requirements:

>= 512 MB main memory

(but 1 GB is better).

Disc space:

For the full OKplatform, with some versions of gcc and Boost installed:
5 GB are fully sufficient (however with only 1 GB it can get tight,
and for installing everything it is too tight).

----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------


Building:

1) In the OKplatform-directory (where this README
is placed), call

./oklib --prebuild

This creates links and directories.


2) For using the package, we need "oklib" on your path (or otherwise you
   have to call it always with its full path):

 - One symbolic link is already planted in the base directory OKplatform
   (you have used that in Step 1)), but this is only for the purpose of setting 
   up the OKlibrary, and is otherwise of restricted use.

 - The public bin-directory "OKplatform/bin" (in this directory) contains
   links to the main executables supplied by the OKlibrary, 
   including "oklib".
 - So you can put this bin-directory on your path via adding
export PATH=OKPLATFORM/bin:${PATH}
   to ~/.bashrc, where OKPLATFORM is to be replaced by the (absolute)
   path to the OKplatform-directory. In order to conveniently use
   all main programs supplied by the OKlibrary, this step is RECOMMENDED.

 - Or you can set up a symbolic link to oklib in ~/bin.

   Remark: It seems that on some systems (like (K)Ubuntu) ~/bin is not
   automatically element of PATH, so you would need to add ~/bin to
   your path in the bash-resources-file.

   DEPRECATED: If you call
     ./oklib --setup
   in directory OKplatform, then the build system will create a symbolic
   link to oklib in ~/bin.

Once you decided on how to access "oklib" in the future, you might delete the
symbolic link in directory OKplatform.

The master script oklib should now be functional. (You can test this
by just calling "oklib --version" somewhere.)


3) Except for the minimal package, precomputed documentation is included
in the documentation (see local home page below).
Regarding the information on the installed external sources, this precomputed
information is not fully relevant for your system (since several test actions 
have to be performed on *your* system), and to (partially) update it use

oklib documentation_index

in directory OKsystem (or below it).

Remarks: 
 - "oklib html" would fully re-install the documentation, however it needs an
   appropriate version of doxygen installed for this. See Step 4).
 - Information on installation status at the main page for "external sources"
   (directly reachable from the local home page, see below) should now
   be correct, but updating the information on the specific installation pages
   needs the full "oklib html".
 - If you get error messages with "oklib documentation_index" then likely
   this means that the binary "PathDifference" (needed to translate paths and 
   which needs to be compiled by the OKlibrary), which we supply 
   as a binary (in the optimised version), doesn't run on your system (so likely
   your system is not a i386-architecture). "oklib all" in OKsystem will compile it
   (amongst others), but you need gcc and Boost ready for this.

All necessary installations can be carried out through the OKlibrary; see
information on external sources on the local home page.


4) "oklib documentation_index" cannot update for examples the links in the
html-documentation to documentation of external sources. To get the documentation
fully updated, run "oklib html" (in directory OKsystem or below).

For this doxygen is needed. The OKlibrary provides a local installation, which
you can execute by calling "oklib doxygen" in directory OKplatform/ExternalSources.
After this installation is finished, "oklib html" should then run successfully.


5) In order to use the version control system, we recommend to install git
via the OKlibrary, again by running "oklib git" in directory 
OKplatform/ExternalSources.

Again, after installation a link is planted in the public bin-directory 
OKplatform/bin.

Git comes with modern Linux distributions, but the OKlibrary should provide
the most suitable version (either the newest one, or in case of some trouble
an appropriate earlier version).


6) The most convenient way to install the Maxima/Lisp computer-algebra-system 
for SAT experimentation is by running "oklib allmaxima" in directory 
OKplatform/ExternalSources.


----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------

All further documentation is found on the local home page in

OKplatform/system_directories/doc/local_html/index.html.

(Note that for the minimal package the documentation is not pre-installed,
but has to be created by running "oklib html" (see Step 4) above).)

Licence text: See OKplatform/OKsystem/Transitional/System/LegalIssues/GPLv3.txt

----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites (need to be installed):

 - Bash, version 3.00 or higher
   (check: run "bash --version")
 - GNU make, version 3.80 or higher
  (check: run "make --version")
 - gcc

For creation of documentation we also need:

 - the Qt library
 - Latex
 - the m4 preprocessor.

Any recent Linux distribution supplies these prerequisites.

There are other Unix/Linux tools, which some "lean distributions"
do not include (we propose you better go with a "fat distribution"),
e.g.

sudo
dos2unix
mmv

And Latex should include the srcltx-package.

----------------------------------------------

System requirements:

>= 512 MB main memory

(but 1 GB is better).

Disc space:

For the full OKplatform, with some versions of gcc and Boost installed:
5 GB are fully sufficient (however with only 1 GB it can get tight,
and for installing everything it is too tight).

----------------------------------------------

Building:

1) For using the package, we need "oklib" on your path (or otherwise you
   have to call it always with its full path):

 - One symbolic link is already planted in the base directory OKplatform,
   but this is only for the purpose of setting up the OKlibrary, and is
   otherwise of restricted use.
 - The public bin-directory "OKplatform/bin" (in this directory) contains 
   links to the main executables supplied by the OKlibrary, including "oklib".
 - So you can put this bin-directory on your path.
 - Or you can set up a symbolic link to oklib in ~/bin; if you call
     ./oklib --setup
   in directory OKplatform, then the build system will create this link in ~/bin.
   Remark: It seems that on some systems (like (K)Ubuntu) ~/bin is not
   automatically element of PATH; we would recommend to add it to
   your path in the bash-resources-file.

Once you decided on how to access "oklib" in the future, you might delete the
symbolic link in directory OKplatform.

2) The master script oklib should now be functional.
The next is to prepare the build system: Call

oklib --prebuild

3) Except for the minimal package, precomputed installation is included.
Regarding the information on the installed external sources, this precomputed
information is not fully relevant for your system (since several test actions 
have to be performed), and to update it use

oklib documentation_index

in directory OKsystem (or below it).

Remarks: 
 - "oklib html" would install the full documentation, however it needs an
   appropriate version of doxygen installed for this.
 - If you get error messages with "oklib documentation_index" then likely
   this means that one binary, which is needed to translate paths and which
   needs to be compiled by the OKlibrary, and which we supply as a binary,
   doesn't run on your system. "oklib all" in OKsystem will compile it
   (amongst others), but you need gcc and Boost ready for this.

All necessary installations can be carried out through the OKlibrary; see
information on external sources on the local home page.

----------------------------------------------

All further documentation is found on the local home page in

OKplatform/system_directories/doc/local_html/index.html.

(However, for the minimal package the documentation is not pre-installed,
but has to be created by running "oklib html" (which needs doxygen installed).)

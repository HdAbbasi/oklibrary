  \brief Plans for the README file


  \todo DONE (The documentation is mainly provided by the local
  home page)
  Automatic generation:
  <ul>
   <li> The README-file must be automatically produced from
   the configuration data, using some template, which is
   filled with the current information by preprocessing. </li>
   <li> Besides the text-file, also an html-page is produced. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE (this information is now due to the ExternalSources
  module)
  Supported versions of gcc:
  We need to clean-up regarding the supported versions of gcc.
  Perhaps actually we should support only from 4.1.1 onwards.


  \todo Update: DONE (see new todo "Automatic generation")
  As much as possible the information in the README file must be kept
  automatically synchronised with the real library.

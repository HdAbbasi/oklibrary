  \brief Plans for the README file


  \todo Creating an html-version
  <ul>
   <li> We should additionally provide README.html, produced from
   README, which is provided with the package (additionally to
   README), and also on the local home page under the new
   documentation topic "Installation". </li>
   <li> From the Internet page there needs to be an additional
   link to this installation-page. </li>
   <li> Running "asciidoc --doctype=book README" produces "README.html",
   which is already quite nice. </li>
   <li>
  </ul>

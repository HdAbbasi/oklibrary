  \brief Plans regarding the release process in general

  The different aspects of the release process (including the "continuous
  releases" via source-control access) are considered in:
  <ul>
   <li> Buildsystem/ReleaseProcess/plans/MailingLists.hpp treats all different
   aspects regarding e-mail communication. </li>
   <li> Buildsystem/ReleaseProcess/plans/PackageBuilding.hpp considers building
   the packages for the releases. </li>
   <li> Buildsystem/ReleaseProcess/plans/README.hpp looks at the README-file
   in the package. </li>
   <li> Buildsystem/ReleaseProcess/plans/Release.hpp looks at the overall
   process for preparing a (special) release. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Plans-structure review:
  The plans-structure in Buildsystem/ReleaseProcess/plans/ needs review.
  <ul>
   <li> Should we make a distinction between "special releases" and
   "continuous releases" ? </li>
  </ul>

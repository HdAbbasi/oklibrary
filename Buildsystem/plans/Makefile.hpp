  \brief Plans for the buildsystem-makefile


  \todo Future of this makefile:
  <ul>
   <li> The ugly variable generic_dirs will vanish with the appearance of
   the masterscript "oklib" (which will call the appropriate makefile).
   And also all other links will likely vanish. </li>
   <li> So the only task left is to create some directories? However this can be handled
   by Buildsystem/SetUp.mak. </li>
   <li> So perhaps after the transition SetUp.mak is renamed to Makefile (taking over
   Buildsystem/Makefile. </li>
  </ul>

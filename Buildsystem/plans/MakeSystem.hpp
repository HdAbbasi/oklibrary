  \brief Plans for the core part of the build system, the
  make- or make-like engine

  \todo CMake
  <ul>
   <li> Investigate how our main tasks can be handled by cmake. (It seems
   to me a nice system, and likely we should do the transition.) </li>
   <li> How would the work flow be with the new system (the 2 levels,
   the cmake- and the make-level)? </li>
   <li> Is ccmake useful? </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for the README file

  \todo Supported versions of gcc:
  We need to clean-up regarding the supported versions of gcc.
  Perhaps actually we should support only from 4.1.1 onwards.

  \todo Update:
  As much as possible the information in the README file must be kept
  automatically synchronised with the real library.

  \brief Documentation on how to build and use Boost


  <h1> Installing and using Boost </h1>


  <h2> On the purpose of Boost </h2>

  Boost is the main C++ library besides the standard library, for all purposes,
  and in general of the highest standard.


  <h2> What the installation yields </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> The %boost header files and the corresponding link libraries XXX </li>
   <li> Documentation XXX </li>
   <li> Corrections:
    <ol>
     <li> At this time (May 2009) we are stuck with version 1_34_1 due to
     changes in the Boost behaviour causing build-failures for our programs.
     </li>
     <li> The package provided, "boost_1_34_1.tar.bz2", is actually patched
     w.r.t. known defective files. </li>
     <li> There are known errors with the serialisation library, but yet
     we don't use this library. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The bzip2-library is needed to build Boost; we provide a (patched)
   local installation by using <code>oklib bzip2</code>. This isinstalled by
   default when installing the full package, while otherwise it needs to
   be installed before installing Boost. </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> Usage </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> To include a boost-header use for example
   \code
#include <boost/iostreams/categories.hpp>
   \endcode
   together with "${boost_include_option_okl}" XXX XXX). </li>
   <li> To link with %Boost, use "${boost_link_option_okl}" XXX for each sub-library separately XXX. </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> Current state of installation </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Recommended version = <code>$(boost_recommended_version_number)</code> </li>
   <li> %boost include option = <code>$(boost_include_option_okl)</code> XXX </li>
   <li> %boost link option = <code>$(boost_link_option_okl)</code> XXX </li>
   <li> ready: $(boost_ready)
    <ul>
     <li> mode = <code>$(boost_default_install)</code> </li>
     <li> version = <code>$(version_boost)</code>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> documentation: $(boost_html_documentation_index_location_tag) </li>
   <li> list of supported versions XXX </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> How to install </h2>

  Some general remarks:
  <ul>
   <li> Currently only local installation is provided, using the
   local gcc. </li>
  </ul>

  Prerequisites:
  <ul>
   <li> If the required local installation of gcc is not available, then it
   needs to be built first (by <code>oklib gcc</code>); currently this is not
   handled by the build system). </li>
   <li> Another prerequisite is the locally installed bzip2-library (install
   by <code>oklib bzip2</code>). </li>
  </ul>

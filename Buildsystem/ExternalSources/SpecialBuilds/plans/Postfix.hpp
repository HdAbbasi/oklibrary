  \brief Plans regarding installation of the Postfix package

  Postfix is for actively sending e-mails and possibly passively
  receiving e-mails:
  <ul>
   <li> Mailman could possibly send e-mails to remote mail-servers
   itself, but it seems much easier that Mailman delivers all e-mails
   to a local mail-server (postfix here), and then the local
   mail-server takes over and delivers it to the remote servers. </li>
   <li> Furthermore, Mailman needs to be notified about received
   e-mails. The best way to achieve this seems to be that some service
   (direct delivery or pulling the mail via e.g. fetchmail) delivers
   the e-mail to the local mail-server (Postfix(!)), which in turn
   has hooks for special actions for special e-mails, in this case
   for calling some dedicated mailman-script which hands over the
   e-mail to the Mailman-system. </li>
  </ul>

  Installing and using Postfix happens as follows:
  <ol>
   <li> Installing Postfix by the OKlibrary is only recommended if no
   Postfix is already in service on the machine (or, more generally,
   no e-mail is sent otherwise from this machine using some mail-server). </li>
   <li> If deemed necessary, then Postfix is installed (system-wide) as
   explained below. </li>
   <li> Later then, when installing Mailman, respective "aliases" have to
   be installed (then) to tell Postfix that certain e-mail-addresses shall trigger
   delivery to the Mailman-system. </li>
  </ol>


  \todo Building Postfix on a freshly setup test machine :
  <ul>
   <li>
   \verbatim  
ExternalSources/Installations> mkdir Postfix
ExternalSources/Installations> cd Postfix
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix> wget ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/mail/postfix/official/postfix-2.4.5.tar.gz
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix> tar -zxvf postfix-2.4.5.tar.gz
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix> cd postfix-2.4.5
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> make
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo groupadd postfix
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo useradd postfix -s /bin/false -g postfix
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo groupadd postdrop
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo mkdir /etc/postfix
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo cp ../../../../OKsystem/Transitional/BuildSystem/Configuration/ReleaseProcess/main.cf /etc/postfix/main.cf
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo make upgrade
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo touch /etc/aliases
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo newaliases
   \endverbatim
   <li> The following step (involving syslog-ng.conf) might be hard to generalise as there are several 
   different syslog daemons and there will probably be preexisting configurations.
   How to solve this?
   </li>
   \verbatim
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo cat ../../../../OKsystem/Transitional/Buildsystem/Configuration/ReleaseProcess/syslog-ng.conf >>  /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo syslog-ng restart
ExternalSources/Installations/Postfix/postfix-2.4.5> sudo postfix start
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> The above configuration should go to a configuration-file. -DONE
   MG - Should this file (syslog-ng.conf, referenced above) be specially named
   as it is not a complete configuration file but merely a fragment? </li>
   <li> How can we make sure, that if we install sendmail, that then *our*
   installation is used by mailman? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Installation script
  <ul>
   <li> Create the original postfix-configuration-file in
   Buildsystem/Configuration/ReleaseProcess. </li>
   <li> Add configuration-variables to adapt it. </li>
   <li> The Postfix-installation-makefile then creates from this template
   the final configuration-file (similar to the doxygen-configuration-file). </li>
   <li> Otherwise a simple standard makefile is written for installing Postfix, as
   above, but using three sub-targets:
    <ol>
     <li> main-installation </li>
     <li> syslog-configuration </li>
     <li> alias-installation </li>
    </ol>
    (Alias-installation here is independent of any specific mailman-issues.)
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Writing docus page
  <ul>
   <li> At least a quick overview is needed on what this thing is doing. </li>
  </ul>

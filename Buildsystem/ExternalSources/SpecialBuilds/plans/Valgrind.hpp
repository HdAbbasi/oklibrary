  \brief Plans regarding building of the Valgrind tool


  \todo Install version 3.6.0


  \todo Update
  <ul>
   <li> The build-code needs a complete overhaul. </li>
   <li> Our documentation needs an update. </li>
   <li> Compare "Enable local/global installation for all packages" in
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> Likely local installation just needs to put the provided
   executables into OKplatform/bin. But anyway, the default should be local
   installation. </li>
  </ul>

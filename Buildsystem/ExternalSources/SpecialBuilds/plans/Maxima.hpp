  \brief Plans regarding installation of Maxima


  \todo Install Maxima
  <ul>
   <li> Maxima 5.13 seems appropriate. </li>
   <li> The installation has a sub-target "access-script":
    <ol>
     <li> This Bash-script is copied to ~/bin (overwriting existing
     files), under the name "Maxima", and it calls the maxima-program,
     passing parameters and loading all functions from the OKlibrary. </li>
     <li> All path-information is hardcoded into this script, and it is
     created from a template with "m4_SHELL"-use. </li>
     <li> Perhaps a different script is used for performing tests. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Move all maxima-documention-links from the Sage-documentation
   page to the Maxima documentation. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans regarding installation of Axiom


  \todo Install Axiom
  <ul>
   <li> http://www.axiom-developer.org/ </li>
   <li> The current ("gold") version is from November 2008. </li>
   <li> It is also a rather big package (200 MB) --- what's in there? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Install OpenAxiom
  <ul>
   <li> http://www.open-axiom.org/ </li>
   <li> Currently there is version 1.2.0. </li>
   <li> What are the differences to "Axiom"? Which shall we use?
   It seems "Axiom" is bigger. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo FriCAS
  <ul>
   <li> Another fork is http://fricas.sourceforge.net/. </li>
   <li> This seems to be the least developed form? </li>
  </ul>

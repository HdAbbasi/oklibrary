  \brief Plans regarding installation of Git


  \todo Prerequisites
  <ul>
   <li> The build system can install asciidoc if needed; put it into
   the documentation. (Is it available in recent distributions?) </li>
   <li> What to do about xmlto --- is this available in recent
   distributions, so that we don't need to provide an installation
   ourselves (only documentation)?
    <ol>
     <li> Suse 10.0 has it. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> What about
   \verbatim
/bin/sh: curl-config: command not found
   \endverbatim
   ??? Is this another missing prerequisite? </li>
  </ul>

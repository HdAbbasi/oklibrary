  \brief Plans regarding installation of the Boost library


  \todo Improving building Boost
  <ul>
   <li> Like with gcc, the build-directory and the bjam-directory should not be a
   prerequisite (so that an unnecessary "make boost" is a noop). </li>
   <li> It should be possible to say "gcc-version=recommended". </li>
   <li> Instead of "boost boost_recommended=boost-1_33_1" we should use
   "boost boost-version=1_33_1". </li>
   <li> The default for OKlibBuilding/Makefile is to use the recommended <strong>local</strong>
   gcc-installation --- shouldn't this then be also for building %boost
   the default ? </li>
   <li> Installation of bjam should be improved: Having exactly one
   bjam-installation for each boost-version, and no need to recreate
   it if it's already there. Or, perhaps better: We just leave it in
   the distribution directory --- this seems reasonable: We don't use
   bjam ourselves, and thus by removing the additional steps
   our systems becomes simpler! </li>
   <li> What happens with copying the documentation- files and directories
   if the target- files and/or directories are already there? DONE ("cp -r"
   copies directories/files which are not already present, and actually
   replaces them if they are already there (in any case!)) </li>
   <li> Building %boost should include copying the documentation to doc
   (in the subdirectory boost-1_33_1 for example). DONE </li>
   <li> In the long run, it seems that actually supporting different versions
   of Boost is not feasible (the library will likely always use the newest
   version), so finally supporting different Boost version should be dropped
   (but the general machinery is worth keeping)?!? DONE Very likely most of the times we will support only one boost-version --- but we need the machinery for the transition to newer version (then for some times 2 versions are around)! And we might try out beta-versions etc. So we need the boost-build-machinery. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Problems with building Boost
  <ul>
   <li> Report to Boost: How to call the libraries is not documented, %e.g.,
   the only library-name mentioned is "Boost.Python", while its real name
   is "python". (Important for "--without-libraries=python".)
   </li>
   <li> How to inform bjam about an alternative compiler? What about
   <code> "-sGCC_ROOT_DIRECTORY=$(gcc-base-directory)/$(2)" </code> ??
   </li>
   <li> When building gcc with local versions, we should make sure that
   the system-gcc doesn't interfere (especially important regarding linking).
    <ol>
     <li> On cs-wsok it seems that the system-gcc (4.0.2) interferes;
     perhaps it tries to link with the 32bit-version, can't do that,
     and then falls back to the system version? </li>
     <li> What is the role of LD_LIBRARY_PATH ?? (On cs-wsok it is empty.) </li>
     <li> We should check in general whether building %boost links to the 32bit
     or to the 64bit version. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (to be ignored for now) On cs-ltok (32 bit) we get build-log-messages like
   \verbatim
`.L1119' referenced in section `.rodata' of bin.v2/libs/serialization/build/gcc-3.4.3/debug/threading-multi/xml_iarchive.o: defined in discarded section `.gnu.linkonce.t._ZNK5boost7archive17archive_exception4whatEv' of bin.v2/libs/serialization/build/gcc-3.4.3/debug/threading-multi/xml_iarchive.o
`.L573' referenced in section `.rodata' of bin.v2/libs/serialization/build/gcc-3.4.3/debug/threading-multi/xml_oarchive.o: defined in discarded section `.gnu.linkonce.t._ZNK5boost7archive17archive_exception4whatEv' of bin.v2/libs/serialization/build/gcc-3.4.3/debug/threading-multi/xml_oarchive.o
   \endverbatim
   Does this indicate something we should worry about ?
   </li>
   <li> DONE (to be ignored for now) On cs-wsok (64 bit) we get
   \verbatim
ExternalSources> make boost-1_34_0

...failed updating 8 targets...
...skipped 24 targets...
...updated 5517 targets...
   \endverbatim
   Rerunning reveals
   \verbatim
...failed gcc.link.dll /h/21/GemeinsameBasis/SAT-Algorithmen/OKplatform/ExternalSources/Boost/1_34_0+4.1.2_Build/boost/bin.v2/libs/wave/build/gcc-4.1.2/debug/threading-multi/libboost_wave-gcc41-mt-d-1_34.so.1.34.0...
gcc.link.dll /h/21/GemeinsameBasis/SAT-Algorithmen/OKplatform/ExternalSources/Boost/1_34_0+4.1.2_Build/boost/bin.v2/libs/graph/build/gcc-4.1.2/debug/threading-multi/libboost_graph-gcc41-mt-d-1_34.so.1.34.0
collect2: ld terminated with signal 11 [Segmentation fault]
   \endverbatim
   So there are linking problems regarding the wave- and the graph-library.
   This seems not to be of urgent concern for now (but the problem must be
   fixed in the future).
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Complete Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/docus/Boost.hpp. </li>
   <li> Mention that the mcp-tools (mln, mmv) need to be installed (available in all distributions). </li>
  </ul>

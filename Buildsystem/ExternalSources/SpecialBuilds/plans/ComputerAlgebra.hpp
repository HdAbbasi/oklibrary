  \brief Plans regarding building of computer algebra systems

  </ul>


  \todo General systems
  <ul>
   <li> 
   <li> What about Octave? http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
   It has (only) numerical capabilities, and we should evaluate
   which could be useful for us (sparse matrices and optimisation). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Computational commutative algebra
  <ul>
   <li> CoCoA http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/ </li>
   <li> Singular: http://www.singular.uni-kl.de </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Vicinity of computational group theory
  <ul>
   <li> Gap http://www-gap.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/ </li>
   <li> Magnus http://www.grouptheory.org/magnus; perhaps we postpone this,
   since it might be more specialised </li>
   <li> MeatAxe http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/homes/MTX/ (perhaps also
   postponed, since somewhat more specialised) </li>
   <li> Sims' Rutgers Knuth-Bendix package rkbp
   http://users.ox.ac.uk/~vlee/4engel/rkbp/
    <ol>
     <li> Doesn't contain a licence, and thus likely can't be distributed.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (proprietary) Magma </li>
   <li> DONE (included with GAP) ACE3 </li>
   <li> DONE (included with GAP) KBMAG </li>
  </ul>

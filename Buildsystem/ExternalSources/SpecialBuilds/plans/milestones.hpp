  \par Version history

   - 0.2   : 16.7.2007; initial version, several special systems can be build (the special builds are the stronger parts of module ExternalSources, while the general structure is lagging behind).
   - 0.2.1 : 10.8.2007; built Sage and Coq (and Boost 1_34_1), and extended substantially the documentation system (docus pages, functionality checks, and linking).

  \brief Plans regarding building of the GAP system

  
  \todo Improve installation
  <ul>
   <li> We need the list of all packages.
    <ol>
     <li> Also the Guava-package seems of interest. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Can we have a separate installation directory (as usual for us)? </li>
   <li> We should better include also the minor version number into the
   installation/build directory names (so that, as usual, we can have several
   versions in parallel). </li>
   <li> What about this "xtom1r1p4.tar.bz2" ? We should just install it. </li>
   <li> Is it possible to automate tests? </li>
   <li> Monoids:
    <ol>
     <li> Are there newer versions at http://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/ ?
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>

  \brief Plans regarding installation of the Common-Lisp Ecl


  \todo DONE (now only the usual Bessel-problem)
  Update to newest version
  <ul>
   <li> The newest version is 9.8.2. </li>
   <li> It builds, and also Maxima builds with it, but showing quite a few
   failing tests. It seems the tests of not of relevance to us. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Documentation is not included in the package, so we need
   to download it. </li>
   <li> Creating then a wrapper Ecl.html (as CLisp.html). </li>
  </ul>

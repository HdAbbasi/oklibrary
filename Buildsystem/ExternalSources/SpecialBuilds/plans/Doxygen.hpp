  \brief Plans regarding building of Doxygen


  \todo Version 1.6.3
  <ul>
   <li> Installation and usage on cs-wsok seems to be without problems. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Version 1.5.8
  <ul>
   <li> It seems that this version has not much to offer for us. </li>
   <li> On the other hand, it now requires Qt version 4. </li>
   <li> So it seems better to me to wait at least for the next version
   of Doxygen, which perhaps has something more interesting to offer,
   while the availability of Qt4 will have increased. </li>
  </ul>

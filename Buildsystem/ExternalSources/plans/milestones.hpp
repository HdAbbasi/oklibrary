  \par Version history

   - 0.1   : 2.7.2007; extracted from Buildsystem (version 0.1.6). The system
   is running, extensions can be done by "copy-and-paste", but the system grew "organically", so redesign is needed, and also the functionality is too restricted (and sporadic).
   - 0.1.1 : 6.9.2007; new (more extensive) directory structure, completed first versions of docus-files for special builds, and first version of general documentation on the build system; SpecialBuilds advanced to 0.2.1.

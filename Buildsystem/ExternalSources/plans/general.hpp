  \brief Plans for building external sources in general


  \todo Downloading sources
  <ul>
   <li> Via
   "wget $(extsrc_download_OKplatform_okl)/ExternalSources/sources/package"
   we can download all packages needed.
    <ol>
     <li> Variable extsrc_download_OKplatform_okl is apparently yet not
     provided (in some form), and likely should be placed in
     Configuration/ExternalSources/all.mak. </li>
     <li> Currently we have variable oklibrary_domain in
     Configuration/Html/local_html.mak. But the download directory is not
     "local"? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Via "make download" the system should download all the packages from
   the source-directory as provided on the OKlibrary web site. </li>
   <li> See "Update" below for completely updating the external sources. </li>
   <li> How to know which files to download?
    <ol>
     <li> We have all information locally available in
     Buildsystem/ExternalSources/sources. </li>
     <li> So the process just runs through this directory, and downloads all
     those files which are not present currently. </li>
     <li> This could be done very simply by just calling wget with
     the complete list of files and using option "-nc". </li>
     <li> Perhaps we should compute first the list of missing files
     via a simple loop, and write this into a file (under
     system_directories/log), so that it can be inspected later. </li>
     <li> Then we just call wget with this input-file, and expect to
     obtain them all. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (we only provide a "complete download", plus instructions how
   to get single files)
   Due to the (apparent) impossibility of translating a target
   into some other target computed from it, we cannot use the source-archives
   as prerequisites of the rules, but we have to check it manually. </li>
   <li> Even when the source-archive is existing, we should check the md5sum.
    <ol>
     <li> Should we use the system md5sum, or our own? </li>
     <li> Perhaps, in order to promote building the full OKlibrary,
     we make our own md5sum the default. </li>
     <li> Overwriting the corresponding make-variables allows to use
     the system make. </li>
     <li> This is already achieved by ext_src_checksum (in
     Configuration/ExternalSources/all.mak), but which should
     be renamed to "ext_src_checksum_okl", and whose default value should be
     the local md5sum. </li>
     <li> There should be a sub-target "check_md5sum" for checking. </li>
     <li> This runs through all the files in
     Buildsystem/ExternalSources/sources/*, checks whether the corresponding
     file exists, and if so then checks the md5sum. </li>
     <li> So target "download" has sub-targets "check_md5sum", "list_missing"
     and "download_missing" (in this order). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Update
  <ul>
   <li> Above in "Downloading sources" the ExternalSources-sources are
   downloaded. </li>
   <li> After downloading, one could simple use "oklib cleanall", followed
   by "oklib all". However, this is very time-consuming. </li>
   <li> Here now we attempt at a new make-target "reinstall", which will
   re-install all new software if necessary. </li>
   <li> The target "update" then first calls "download" and then "reinstall",
   and finally "oklib --prebuild" is executed. </li>
   <li> Yet it is not clear what is done by make, and what directly by
   oklib. </li>
   <li> A major question is how to find out what to update. We could create a
   new history file, which contains the git-ID plus the make-target of all
   installation action. </li>
   <li> Whenever something new is installed, then an entry is added. </li>
   <li> This file is likely best placed in Buildsystem/ExternalSources. </li>
   <li> And for every installation, in the installation directory the git-ID
   at the time of the installation is stored. </li>
   <li> "oklib reinstall" then checks for each external source, whether
   a new installation has happened (if no information is available, then
   it is installed). </li>
   <li> If several installations were done meanwhile, then only the latest
   is performed. </li>
   <li> This installation process has to obey the dependencies between
   external sources (which are not yet explicitly expressed); see point
   "Dependencies" below. </li>
   <li> DONE (new the informations provided by Git are used)
   Creating the list of targets:
    <ol>
     <li> The list of targets of external sources to be installed is given
     currently by "all : buildsystem compilers libraries math sat" in
     ExternalSources/Makefile. </li>
     <li> One has to go through these external sources now, checking whether
     the installation exists and has the current version number, and if not,
     then to issue the install command. </li>
     <li> See "Dependencies" below. </li>
     <li> So first "checkext" is to be called, and if then the timestamp-file
     doesn't exist, then the target is listed for update; see "File with
     installation data" below. </li>
     <li> This all should be managed by respective make-rules. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (this proposal seems counterintuitive: "all" should just mean
   the installation of "everything")
   Perhaps "reinstall" becomes the new "all"; "all" currently doesn't
   need to check for existing installations, but if we support other than
   local installations (internal to the OKlibrary), then this will be
   needed. </li>
   <li> One needs to be careful with cleaning-up after the installation:
    <ol>
     <li> One should only clean-up after a successful installation. </li>
     <li> Then perhaps only the build-directory is removed. </li>
     <li> Perhaps for every external sources ext we have an additional
     "cleanoldext" target, which removes all other files in Installations/Ext
     besides the current installation directory. </li>
     <li> And as an additional general cleaning target we have "cleanold",
     which calls "cleanoldext" for all ext's. </li>
     <li> Perhaps when installing, nothing is cleaned before (or after), and
     it is the responsibility of the user to do so. </li>
     <li> There is also the need for cleaning-up old source packages (which
     can, over time, use a lot of disc space); perhaps we have some cleaning
     command which removes from OKplatform/ExternalSources/sources everything
     which is not in Buildsystem/ExternalSources/sources. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> File with installation data:
    <ol>
     <li> Perhaps first the list of external sources to be re-installed is
     put into a file (with current version number, if existing, and new
     version numbers), and also printed out to screen, with a request for the
     user to confirm installation. </li>
     <li> Perhaps actually at this time the user can edit the file,
     removing or adding external sources, and changing version numbers. </li>
     <li> So reinstall has subtargets "installdata" and "install", where
     installdata creates the file with the installation data (each external
     source has one line), and install performs line for line the installation.
     </li>
     <li> So the user can call install directly, given that he has
     provided the data in the file. </li>
     <li> If possible, we should actually let the make-program create that
     file or its lines (so that all dependencies are managed). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Dependencies:
    <ol>
     <li> We now need to make the dependencies between external sources
     explicit. </li>
     <li> Then we also need to have a way of checking whether an external
     source is installed or not. </li>
     <li> So apparently the old filestamps are needed again. Perhaps they
     aren't needed anymore, though, given the git-ID-files. </li>
     <li> For each external source ext, there is a target "checkext", which
     checks whether ext is installed with the current version number, and
     in the positive case creates a timestamp-file "ext_installed", and
     otherwise removes this file (if it exists). </li>
     <li> Installation then calls "ext_installed" at the end. </li>
     <li> Better we avoid making dependencies aware of version numbers. </li>
     <li> We could use the Git-history instead? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Logging:
    <ol>
     <li> One needs to make sure that all logs together go into the log-file,
     not just the log of the last build. </li>
     <li> Or perhaps we better have a log-file for each external source! </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Interfaces via OKplatform/bin
  <ul>
   <li> We should make nearly all executables from ExternalSources
   available in the public bin-directory (typically via symbolic links). </li>
   <li> In this way after for example the version of doxygen
   has changed, still the build can work with the old version
   (since the "interface", OKplatform/bin/doxygen, is independent
   of the version). </li>
   <li> Perhaps, additionally to "doxygen_call_okl", we should
   introduce "doxygen_public_call_okl" ? </li>
   <li> Better to introduce "doxygen_internal_call_okl", which
   contains the full address for the internal call, while, as
   before, "doxygen_call_okl" contains how to call doxygen
   from the build-system. </li>
   <li> On problem arising in this way is that for example then
   the user is tempted to just call "maxima", which doesn't connect
   to the OKlibrary.
    <ol>
     <li> So well, seems alright to have the distinction between
     "oklib --maxima" and plain "maxima". </li>
     <li> But we should point out that the normal use is via
     "oklib --maxima". </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Units to change:
    <ol>
     <li> Doxygen
      <ol>
       <li> The symbolic links are already there, we only need to change
       doxygen_call_okl etc. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> CLisp
      <ol>
       <li> We need symbolic links to "clisp" and to "lisp.run". </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Maxima
      <ol>
       <li> A plain symbolic link is sufficient. </li>
       <li> We need to mention
       Installations/Maxima/5.15.0/share/maxima/5.15.0/share/maxima-init.mac.
       </li>
       <li> HOWEVER, at present we should not encourage users do run maxima
       by themselves, since we do not have any control over maxima-init.mac:
        <ul>
         <li> If one is placed in ~/.maxima, then this will be ALWAYS used,
         destroying the oklib-maxima-usage! </li>
         <li> So this directory should not be present! </li>
         <li> This is clearly a maxima-bug. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> Sage
      <ul>
       <li> Only the sage-script needs to be made available. </li>
       <li> Apparently the build is incomplete yet: The line
       \verbatim
SAGE_ROOT="....."
       \endverbatim
       in the sage-script needs to be changed to contain the full path. </li>
       <li> Then a symbolic link works. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> R
      <ol>
       <li> A plain symbolic link is sufficient. </li>
       <li> We need to point out in the documentation which files
       are preloaded in this way. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Elaborated directory structure
  <ul>
   <li> Four sub-directories of OKplatform/ExternalSources:
    <ol>
     <li> builds </li>
     <li> Docs </li>
     <li> Installations </li>
     <li> sources </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Perhaps we rename "doc" to "docs" ? </li>
   <li> Rewrite all build-make-files and make-variables to take
   account of the new directory structure. </li>
   <li> And then SpecialBuilds should be subdivided, perhaps best
   in accordance to the sub-division on the external-sources
   overview page. </li>
   <li> But this subdivision perhaps best is avoided for
   OKplatform/ExternalSources. </li>
   <li> DONE Perhaps better "Docs" and "Installations", since if
   these directories are deleted, then something is lost. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Building documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Documentation building should be done automatically when building.
   </li>
   <li> We should extract only the documentation from the archives (and
   remove everything else which is not needed). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Documenting changes of files outside of the OKplatform directory
  <ul>
   <li> We need to collect and document all such actions outside the realm
   of the OKlibrary. </li>
   <li> Sage creates an ".ipythonrc" directory is created in the HOME
   directory if it doesn't exist (and this should be it). </li>
   <li> Maxima
    <ol>
     <li> Gnuplot creates some files in the HOME directory. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
   

  \todo General
  <ul>
   <li> It should always be possible, to install something independently and
   only to specify where to find something (so for every special build there
   needs to be a specification what this build actually provides).
   See "Software management" in
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/plans/Configuration.hpp. </li>
   <li> The naming-scheme "gcc_recommended_version_number_okl" is no longer
   appropriate, and should to be replaced by "gcc_version_okl":
    <ol>
     <li> Of course, similar in all the other cases. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (the default is to install everything locally)
   For "make all" we have the following problems:
    <ul>
     <li> The user cannot wait for "sudo". </li>
     <li> Perhaps for example asciidoc is already installed, and this
     suffices? </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (we always use "copy -f" resp. "copy -fr", overriding
   existing old versions; if a renaming is necessary, then perform
   first this copying, and then use "mv -f")
   Regarding documentation building: Currently boost.mak overrides old
   (existing) documentation, while gcc.mak leaves it intact --- should we
   have a general policy about it? Yet the plan is to make experiences and
   see what is better.
    <ul>
     <li> It seems that "always replace", exploiting this behaviour of
     the cp-command, seems more standard. </li>
     <li> One point in favour for the different treatment in gcc.mak is,
     that there  we want to eliminate the doc-subdirectory of the installation
     directory, and then "mv" seems safer than the sequence "cp -r rm -r"
     (what if some parameters are not set right, and rm goes wild?);
     perhaps this is not very strong. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (transferred to
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/general.hpp)
   It would be good, if after doing a local installation, easily the
   installation could also be made global. See Gmp.mak and
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/Gmp.hpp for the new scheme.
   </li>
   <li> DONE (transferred to
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/general.hpp)
   Optionally there should be also local versions of valgrind and
   doxygen (and other tools). This is necessary on systems where the user
   does not have root access. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Using CMake
  <ul>
   <li> It seems that the special makefile for external sources might be a
   suitable candidate for using CMake. </li>
   <li> Compare "CMake" in Buildsystem/OKlibBuilding/plans/MakeSystem.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Complete Buildsystem/ExternalSources/docus/Internals.hpp
  <ul>
   <li> Complete the text. </li>
   <li> Explain, how to obtain the special installation instructions, such that
     in case of a problem the problem can be reproduced independently of
     the OKlibrary (necessary for requests to mailing lists associated
     with the special packages). It should be possible to run
     the make-file in protocol mode, so that the sequence of build
     instructions can be extracted. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Finish docus for special builds


  \todo %Tools
  <ul>
   <li> Investigate the NiX system (a system for managing libraries). </li>
  </ul>

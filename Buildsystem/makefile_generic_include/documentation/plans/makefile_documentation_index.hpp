  \brief Plans for the documentation index makefile

  \todo Logo
   - Perhaps the logo can be improved. Maybe just blue, without any gradient.
  
  \todo OKlibrary link
   - The documentation for OKlibrary should stand out from the others.

  \todo Version numbers
   - instead of "v0.0.1" we should have "Transitional Version 0.1.0"

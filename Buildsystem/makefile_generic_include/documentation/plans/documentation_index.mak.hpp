  \brief Plans for the documentation index makefile

  \todo Logo
   - Perhaps the logo can be improved. Maybe just blue, without any gradient.
   - An possible alternative is not to use any logo, and only use the stylesheet
     to specify a nice font.  

  \todo OKlibrary link
   - The documentation for OKlibrary should stand out from the others. 
   - Perhaps we have a section just for the OKlibrary which has links to the
     documentation for the html documentation and also links to the 
     meta-documentation.

  \todo Version numbers
   - instead of "v0.0.1" we should have "Transitional Version 0.1.0"

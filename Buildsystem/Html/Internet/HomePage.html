    <h1> The OKlibrary </h1>

    The OKlibrary is an open-source research platform and generative
    library for generalised SAT solving (released under GPLv3).


    <h2> Current status </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The current version is m4_SHELL(transitional_version). </li>
      <li> The ALPHA RELEASE is planned with version 0.2.1 (anticipated
       m4_SHELL(deadline_021)). </li>
      <li> The BETA RELEASE is planned with version 0.2.3 (anticipated
       m4_SHELL(deadline_023)). </li>
      <li> The RELEASE is planned with version 0.3 (anticipated
       m4_SHELL(deadline_030)). </li>
    </ul>


    <h2> On-line documentation </h2>

    <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_ihp_local_home_page_output)"> The local documentation </a>
    gives access to the "local home page", the index page for the documentation
    as on your system:
    <ul>
      <li> This is a copy of the documentation on one of the developers
        machines. </li>
      <li> It shall show you the documentation on a real working system. </li>
      <li> So information about the state of installed external sources
        is only there to show an example (on every installed system it
        might look different). </li>
      <li> And links from doxygen-created pages to external html-pages won't
        work, since the link is an absolute path-name (on the developers
        machine). </li>
      <li> These absolute path-names are required by the build system, and they
        are also informative --- to show you where what is located (that is.
        on a real system, not on the Internet-mirror). </li>
    </ul>
    Communication happens via the <a href="m4_SHELL(oklibrary_mailinglists)">
      mailing lists</a>, which allow free subscription.


    <h2> Download </h2>

    The <a href="../packages">download directory</a> contains three kind of packages:
    <ol>
      <li> Minimal packages, with just the repository (also checked out)
        and the directory scaffolding. </li>
      <li> Standard packages, which contain additionally the
        pre-created documentation (so that is doesn't need to be
        built). </li>
      <li> Full packages, which additionally contain also all
        sources for external sources used by the library. </li>
    </ol>
    If in doubt, then download the full package.
    <ul>
      <li> Every package contains the directory "OKplatform"; to extract,
        use <code>tar -xjf package-name</code>. </li>
      <li> For the release history see the history page of the local documentation
        (use the link above). </li>
    </ul>


    <h3> Remarks on the release process </h3>
    
    Some remarks regarding the packages (aspects which might be unusual):
    <ul>
      <li> Due to the character of the OKlibrary as an "active library",
        there is no such thing as "building it" (once), but the library
        comes with the ability of "permanent building" of the many
        parts of the library. For further discussions of such aspects
        see the aims-page of the local documentation.
      </li>
      <li> Due to the active character of the library, and
        also due to its research character, the library always
        comes with the (git) repository.
      </li>
      <li> Due to the extensive amount of external sources, the full
        package is quite big. We do not provide an "external sources only"
        package, since the other parts in the full package are
        "negligible" from the size perspective.
      </li>
      <li> Packages are permanently updated, reflected by running
        numbers, while the version number (with four digits) is
        only advanced from time to time (according to the milestones).
      </li>
      <li> The four digit version number has the following meaning:
        <ol>
          <li> An advance in the first digit is a "big public event"
            (watch the news). </li>
          <li> Advancing the second digit gets a short public announcement
            at places like "SatLive".
          </li>
          <li> Advancing the third digit is an internal event, to be documented
            on the mailing lists.
          </li>
          <li> Advancing the fourth digit is an automatic event, which
            happens when some subgoal is reached (as can be seen
            in the plans).
          </li>
        </ol>
        As mentioned above, the running number is needed, since we might
        release several packages a day, while advancing the version number
        might take weeks.
      </li>
      <li> Updating your already existing OKlibrary-installation can happen
        (at least) in the following ways:
        <ol>
          <li> If you didn't do anything inside your old installation, then
            you can just replace it altogether by the new one. </li>
          <li> If you installed some external sources, but you didn't change
            the OKlibrary itself (inside directory "Transitional"), then
            you can just replace directory Transitional (which is provided
            already with the minimal package). </li>
          <li> If you changed something inside the OKlibrary itself, then you
            should have installed Git, and thus you can pull from the (local)
            unpacked archive, that is, use "git pull path_to_new_Transitional"
            inside the Transitional-directory you want to update. </li>
          <li> You can also pull over the Internet from the central
            public OKlibrary-clone (identical to the latest package), just by
            using <strong>git pull</strong>. </li>
          <li> In any case, if you have downloaded the (new) full package, then
            at least you should replace the old OKplatform/ExternalSources/sources
            by the new directory (if you don't have special reasons to keep old
            packages). </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> Packages are <a href="../archive">archived</a>, but ignoring advances in the fourth
        digit and in the running number (only). </li>
      <li> Due to the research character and its continuous process, there is
        no distinction between "stable" and "unstable" releases. If you wish
        start using the OKlibrary, download the latest package, and later
        perform updates as explained before.
      </li>
    </ul>

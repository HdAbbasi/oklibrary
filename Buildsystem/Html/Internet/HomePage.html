    <h1> The OKlibrary </h1>

    The OKlibrary is an open-source research platform and generative
    library for generalised SAT solving (released under GPLv3).


    <h2> On-line documentation </h2>

    <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_ihp_local_home_page_output)"> The local documentation </a>
    gives access to the "local home page", the index page for the documentation
    as on your system.


    <h2> Download </h2>

    The <a href="../packages">download directory</a> contains three kind of packages:
    <ol>
      <li> Minimal packages, with just the repository (also checked out)
        and the directory scaffolding. </li>
      <li> Standard packages, which contain additionally the
        pre-created documentation (so that is doesn't need to be
        built). </li>
      <li> Full packages, which additionally contain also all
        sources for external sources used by the library. </li>
    </ol>
    Every package contains the directory "OKplatform"; to extract,
    use <code>tar -xjf package-name</code>.

    <p> For the release history see the history page of the local documentation
    (use the link above). </p>


    <h3> Remarks on the release process </h3>
    
    Some remarks regarding the packages (aspects which might be unusual):
    <ul>
      <li> Due to the character of the OKlibrary as an "active library",
        there is no such thing as "building it" (once), but the library
        comes with the ability of "permanent building" of the many
        parts of the library. For further discussions of such aspects
        see the aims-page of the local documentation.
      </li>
      <li> Due to the active character of the library, and
        also due to its research character, the library always
        comes with the (git) repository.
      </li>
      <li> Due to the extensive amount of external sources, the full
        package is quite big. We do not provide an "external sources only"
        package, since the other parts in the full package are
        "negligible" from the size perspective.
      </li>
      <li> Packages are permanently updated, reflected by running
        numbers, while the version number (with four digits) is
        only advanced from time to time (according to the milestones).
      </li>
      <li> The four digit version number has the following meaning:
        <ol>
          <li> An advance in the first digit is a "big public event"
            (watch the news). </li>
          <li> Advancing the second digit gets a short public announcement
            at places like "SatLive".
          </li>
          <li> Advancing the third digit is an internal event, to be documented
            on the mailing lists.
          </li>
          <li> Advancing the fourth digit is an automatic event, which
            happens when some subgoals are reached (as can be seen
            in the plans).
          </li>
        </ol>
        As mentioned above, the running number is needed, since we might
        release several packages a day, while advancing the version number
        might take weeks.
      </li>
      <li> Packages are <a href="../archive">archived</a>, but ignoring advances in the fourth
        digit and in the running number (only). </li>
      <li> Due to the research character and its continuous process, there is
        no distinction between "stable" and "unstable" releases. If you wish
        start using the OKlibrary, download the latest package, and later
        perform updates via source control ("git pull").
      </li>
    </ul>

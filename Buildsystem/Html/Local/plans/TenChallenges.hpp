  \brief Plans for the "Ten Challenges" entry page


  \bug Reference to 10Challenges-directory does not work
  <ul>
   <li> Variable "tenchallenges_doxygen_directory" (in local_html.mak)
   has the value from csltok, but on cs-wsok the hash-value is different. </li>
   <li> With Doxygen 1.6.3 the real address of the page on csltok is
   doxygen_html/dir_2170196fd6532dac3d4cdce46978808a.html . </li>
   <li> See "Doxygen problems regarding stability of links" in
   Buildsystem/Html/Local/plans/general.hpp, where this problem is handled.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Baltimore conference
  <ul>
   <li> We should improve the reference to the Baltimore symposium. </li>
   <li> Providing links to the main conference as well as to the workshop,
   and to the SAT-related sites (if possible). </li>
  </ul>

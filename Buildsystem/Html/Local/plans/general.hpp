  \brief Plans for the main local page


  \todo Complete local home page
  <ul>
   <li> Add a quick tutorial. </li>
   <li> Start a FAQ. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Meta tags
  <ul>
   <li> See "Search engines" in Buildsystem/Html/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> All the documentation should be available (finally) on the web; thus
   the index page will become a publically available web page, and needs all
   the meta tags, and also all the other declarations available, about
   encoding, last change date etc.. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Improved logo
  <ul>
   <li> I (OK) played a bit around with Gimp, and managed to change the
   background colour to white, to cut out the scriptur, and to make it smaller
   (all quite simple): It seems better to me that the picture is basically
   just the scriptur, while the old version seemed to dominant to me. </li>
   <li> Unclear how to handle background colours chosen by the user (different
   from our default). It seems one could make the background of the logo
   transparent, but then the colour of the scriptur becomes problematic.
   So perhaps if we want to use the logo, then we have to fix the
   background-colour? </li>
   <li> The colour of the scriptur is a bit too lavenderish (a touch of darker
   blue perhaps). </li>
   <li> Perhaps a tiny bit of space between "OK" and "library" (looks
   squeezed). </li>
   <li> Comments on how the logo has been created are needed: We need a kind
   of a "generic template" (at least a procedure). Gimp is a powerful tool;
   perhaps we can describe how to create the logo with Gimp? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Better general documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Also a special overview and introduction would be needed;
   ideal a video. </li>
  </ul>

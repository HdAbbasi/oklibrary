  \brief Plans for the local html pages (around the local home page)


  \todo Checking all links
  <ul>
   <li> We need to run from time to time a tool for checking
   the links on the local html pages. </li>
   <li> And this on different types of machines. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Doxygen problems regarding stability of links
  <ul>
   <li> Directory-links are not the same on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms;
   see "Reference to 10Challenges-directory does not work" in
   Buildsystem/Html/Local/plans/TenChallenges.hpp. </li>
   <li> This has been acknowledged as a Doxygen-bug, and shall be submitted
   to the Doxygen bug-tracking system. </li>
   <li> When introducing the new page
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/Ecl.hpp, then the
   address for Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/docus/Ecl.hpp
   changed, so there is a problem with files with the same names.
   Notify the Doxygen mailing list. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Better general documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Also a special overview and introduction would be needed;
   ideal a video. </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for the main local page


  \todo Complete local home page
  <ul>
   <li> Link section for external sources:
    <ol>
     <li> Fill the "ready?"-columns. </li>
     <li> Fill the "installation page"-column. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> A special dedicated link-symbol (created by a style-sheet) perhaps
   would be better (to be used where now "click" appears). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Boost-documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Create Local/plans/ExternalSources.hpp, and move relevant todos there. </li>
   <li> Include documentation for version 1_34_0:
    <ol>
     <li> 15 of the 16 pages are loaded quickly, while the last takes very long. ?? </li>
     <li> Use the recommended version number. DONE </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> We should make available documentation for all supported versions.
   (This is useful for transition periods.) But the main documentation is
   for the recommended version (the rest is provided by links). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo GCC-documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Include documentation for version 4.2.0 (make sure that everything
   is linked).
    <ol>
     <li> Find all the root-pages. </li>
     <li> Use the recommended version number. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> We should make available documentation for all supported versions.
   However the main documentations should be for the recommended version,
   while for the other pages we provide links. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Further documentation
  <ul>
   <li> CMake documentation: Create links to the documentation-pages (in Docs). </li>
   <li> R </li>
   <li> Coq </li>
   <li> Sage </li>
   <li> GMP </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Meta tags:
   - All the documentation should be available (finally) on the web; thus the index page will become
     a publically available web page, and needs all the meta tags, and also all the other declarations
     available, about encoding, last change date etc..


  \todo Improved logo
  <ul>
   <li> I (OK) played a bit around with Gimp, and managed to change to background colour
   to white, to cut out the scriptur, and to make it smaller (all quite simple): It seems
   better to me that the picture is basically just the scriptur, and before it seemed
   to dominant to me. </li>
   <li> Unclear how to handle background colours chosen by the user (different from our default).
   It seems one could make the background of the logo transparent, but then the colour of the
   scriptur becomes problematic. So perhaps if we want to use the logo, then we have to fix
   the background-colour? </li>
   <li> The colour of the scriptur is a bit too lavenderish (a touch of darker blue perhaps). </li>
   <li> Perhaps a tiny bit of space between "OK" and "library" (looks squeezed) </li>
   <li> Comments on how the logo has been created are needed: We need a kind of a
   "generic template" (at least a procedure). Gimp is a powerful tool; perhaps we can
   describe how to create the logo with Gimp? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Better general documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Also a special overview and introduction would be needed;
   ideal a video. </li>
  </ul>

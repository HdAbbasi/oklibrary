    <h1> The main aims and design principles of the OKlibrary </h1>
    
    The OKlibrary is a research platform on generalised satisfiability, providing
    <ul>
      <li> a generative C++ library </li>
      <li> and extensions by computer algebra and proof assistants. </li>
    </ul>

    Special services provided:
    <ul>
      <li> An extensive documentation system, ranging from extracting program documentation
        to planning support. </li>
      <li> The OKlibrary offers installation and usage support for packages and tools
        used for programming and related activies. </li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2> Design principles </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The OKlibrary is a <strong>generative</strong> and <strong>active</strong>
        library, integrating services and activities traditionally not part of the
        delivered package and thus not easily usable:
        <ol>
          <li> In this <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_accu2006_talk_location)"> talk </a>
            the general ideas of "holistic libraries", with emphasise on the
            <strong>higher order unit test system</strong> is outlined.
            <p> Remark on terminology: "generative" and "active" are used in the field
              of generative programming, while "holistic" is my (OK) own version of it.
              These notions are, in general and for our library, under active development. </p>
          </li>
          <li> XXX </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> In this <a href="ProgrammingLanguages.html">discussion</a> the design choices
        for the (formal) languages used in the OKlibrary are considered. The main programming
        language is C++, but for special purposes specialised languages have been selected. </li>
    </ul>

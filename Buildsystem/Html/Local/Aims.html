    <h1> The main aims and design principles of the OKlibrary </h1>

    The report <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_oklibrary_report2009_location)"> The
      OKlibrary: Introducing a "holistic" research platform for (generalised)
      SAT solving </a> gives a general overview on the OKlibrary and its
    basic ideas as of December 2008.


    <h2> Outline </h2>
    
    The OKlibrary is a research platform on generalised satisfiability and related
    fields, providing
    <ul>
      <li> a computer-algebra based system (using Maxima/Lisp) for specification and prototyping, </li>
      <li> a generative C++ library (using modern C++), </li>
      <li> and extensions by external tools, including systems from logic,
        optimisation, statistics and discrete mathematics. </li>
    </ul>
    The library is open source (under GPLv3), and a strong integrated source control
    system yields full control over the development process.

    <p></p>

    Special services provided include:
    <ul>
      <li> A powerful build system for compiling programs and running tests. </li>
      <li> An extensive documentation system, ranging from extracting program documentation
        to planning support. </li>
      <li> Installation and usage support for external packages, including tools
        used for programming and related activities. </li>
    </ul>

    Much emphasise is put on placing the development process in a wider context:
    <ul>
      <li> The relations to neighbour fields, for example constraint satisfaction
        and graph theory, or complexity theory and automated theorem proving,
        are important, and collaboration shall be supported. </li>
      <li> Usage of existing software ("external sources") is strongly encouraged. </li>
      <li> A central problem in using external sources are the various dependencies which
        arise in this way, and the OKlibrary tries to lighten this burden
        by establishing a common environment for installation and usage. </li>
    </ul>


    <h2> The subject </h2>

    "Generalised satisfiability" includes the following fields:
    <ul>
      <li> Constraint satisfaction from the point of view of SAT, that is,
        with emphasise
        <ul>
          <li> on algorithms, not on language, </li>
          <li> and on partial assignments and clauses for reasoning
            and learning algorithms. </li>
        </ul>
        One might say, that
        <ol>
          <li> SAT is considered as an abstract data type, for achieving
        "global intelligence", </li>
          <li> while CSP provides intelligent special methods for
            "local intelligence". </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> Quantified extensions like QBF. </li>
      <li> Generalising clauses like in PB-solvers and SMT. </li>
      <li> Investigations into special structures (for example Ramsey-type problems). </li>
      <li> Any applications. </li>
    </ul>
    Important is the research character, and "purely" theoretical algorithms are welcome.

    <p></p>
    Though not "core business", many other areas are important for SAT, and thus
    are also integrated into the library:
    <ul>
      <li> Logic </li>
      <li> Complexity theory </li>
      <li> Graph and hypergraph theory </li>
      <li> Combinatorics in general </li>
      <li> Algebra. </li>
    </ul>
    To avoid re-inventing many wheels, much emphasise is put on the use of
    external sources.

    For supporting areas like statistics and numerical computation, powerful
    external systems are employed.

    <p></p>

    Modern C++, and generative and active libraries are of importance to overcome
    the split between efficiency and generality, and the library also undertakes
    practical research in these areas.


    <h2> An integrated research environment </h2>

    An open source library which supports research on such a variety of
    fields needs special means for collaboration:
    <ul>
      <li> To support a wide range of research, the library is an "active library",
        and its full use means development within the framework. </li>
      <li> Compared with common "IDEs" ("integrated development environments"),
        the OKlibrary can be understood as an <strong>"IRE"</strong> ("integrated research
        environment"). </li>
      <li> It is possible to use the library in the traditional way, as
        "include-and-link-only", but then many parts of the library are
        left out. </li>
      <li> The library provides means to develop within the library, but
        nevertheless to keep processes encapsulated. </li>
    </ul>


    <h2> A holistic library </h2>

    The OKlibrary is a generative and active
    library, integrating services and activities traditionally not part of the
    delivered package and thus not easily usable:
    <ul>
      <li> In this <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_accu2006_talk_location)"> talk </a>
        the general ideas of "holistic libraries", with emphasise on the
        higher order unit test system (see below), are outlined.
      </li>
      <li> A more complete account is found in this <a
          href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_oklibrary_report2009_location)"> report </a>.
      </li>
      <li> The general principle of active or generative libraries is, that all
        aspects of the programming process (like configuration knowledge)
      should be made available within the system (so that they become
        amenable to automation). </li>
      <li> We go beyond this level by including also planning and discussion
        (which are not amenable to automation). </li>
      <li> At the general level, only C++ is supported as a programming language,
        however for special purposes specialised languages have been selected.
        <ol>
          <li> The <a href="ProgrammingLanguages.html">discussion</a> gives an overview
            on the design choices for the (formal) languages used in the OKlibrary. </li>
          <li> The integration with other programming languages (like Java) shall
            happen via the mechanism of external sources, which make available
            the source code and the compiled products, while the strength of
            C++ is exploited to be able to link with many other languages. </li>
          <li> Interfaces to other SAT libraries are important for the OKlibrary. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    A remark on terminology: "generative" and "active" are used in the field
    of generative programming, while "holistic" is my (OK) own extended version of it.
    These notions are, in general and for our library, under active development.
    

    <h2> The organisation of participation </h2>

    The basic organisation principles for development are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> On the one hand we have the core distribution, over which the core
        development team has control, with me ("OK", that is, Oliver Kullmann) as the
        main developer and copyright holder.
        <ol>
          <li> Strict coding standards and adherence to the design principles
            developed in the OKlibrary make interaction of the many different
            components possible. </li>
          <li> At the C++ level, the development process aims at full
            generality and genericity. </li>
          <li> At the Maxima/Lisp level, the development process aims at
            elegance and clarity combined with precision, avoiding "premature"
            abstraction. </li>
          <li> Prototypes in various forms are supported,
            but this within the framework of abstract ideas developed by the
            OKlibrary. </li>
          <li> Unity of the many theoretical and practical aspects of
            SAT is central to the OKlibrary, which concretely means that
            all components shall work together in one ("big") world --- through
            abstraction by generic and generative programming at the C++ level,
            by systematically developed conversions at the Maxima/Lisp level.
          </li>
          <li> The control over the core distribution includes strict control over
            version numbers (important for communicating the current standing). </li>
          <li> Plans and milestones at the core level can only be developed
            in close collaboration with the core development team. </li>
        </ol>
        Thus development at the core level is under control,
        <ol>
          <li> restricted by necessary adherence to general principles and ideas, </li>
          <li> which shall guarantee that the components admitted play together now and in
            the future. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> On the other hand we have the open space of the "virtual library" as a
        network of distributed clones:
        <ol>
          <li> The anticipated development model for "normal" users is not the centralised
            submission to the core, but a decentralised model. </li>
          <li> Every external developer can take his clone of the OKlibrary
            as the centre of its own universe, where he and his team can
            play the same role as OK and his team for the core library. </li>
          <li> Essential is the idea of the OKlibrary as a "holistic library",
            which is open source taken to the maximum: Every user shall get the
            same possibilities as the core developers. </li>
          <li> If at some point the integration with the core library is wished,
            two basic models are considered:
            <ul>
              <li> Either by a concentrated joined effort the full integration
                into the core (which might make larger rewrites necessary). </li>
              <li> Or the loose integration as an external source, with various
                forms of external testing applied. </li>
            </ul>
            While at the core level a strong effort is undertaken to guarantee
            a high level of development, obviously this is not possible for
            external efforts --- which are then (obviously) free to do whatever
            they want.
          </li>
          <li> Clones of the OKlibrary which go public should make clear their
            heritage (besides what is given by the licence), but also should
            make clear the difference (which likely is in the
            interest of the external group). </li>
          <li> The history of the development of the OKlibrary, as reported by
            the source control system, is integral part of the OKlibrary.
            <ol>
              <li> We expect that every external distribution of clones will
                respect the integrity of the history. </li>
              <li> If external distributions of clones present an incomplete
                or changed history, we will make strong efforts to make
                this publically known. If possible, also legal means
                might be used. </li>
              <li> Here "history" essentially refers to the history as presented
                by the source-code-management-system (Git in our case):
                <ul>
                  <li> "completeness" means that the sequence of submissions is
                    not interrupted; </li>
                  <li> "unchanged" means that the single submissions are unchanged. </li>
                </ul>
                Git was chosen here since it provides cryptographic means for protecting
                the integrity of the history, and it is fast and powerful.
              </li>
              <li> The core development team makes a strong effort to guarantee
                the completeness of the history, so that every contribution,
                small or big, is visible in the history provided by the
                version control. </li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
      </li>      
    </ul>
    We should emphasise, that yet we do not have much experience with the
    "fractal nature" of the "network of clones" (with the OKlibrary as
    its original source), so a lot needs to be learned.


    <h2> The planning process </h2>

    Central is the planning process:
    <ol>
      <li> Every action is announced by plans (in the corresponding plans-file), so that
        others know what's going on and can participate. Also only in this way the typical
        loss due to interruptions is avoided. </li>
      <li> These plans are continuously evolved, so that before programming starts,
        a good "loose specification" is available. </li>
      <li> Plans must be kept up-to-date, and also the corresponding
        milestone-entries. </li>
      <li> So much of the planning process happens *within* the OKlibrary (not, as usual,
        somewhere else). </li>
      <li> The history of the OKlibray thus contains also all ("formalised") planning
        activities. </li>
      <li> Mailinglists are for more informal discussions (finding out about interests,
        "chatting" about the plans (which is to be avoided in the plans-files)).
        So mailinglists are for "pre-discussion", and, potentially, "meta-discussions";
        but as soon things concretise, they should move to the plans-files (only there
        they fully connect to the system). </li>
      <li> To summarise, the planning process
        <ol>
          <li> is somewhat similar to "patchwork", which  comes in small pieces, </li>
          <li> is always in a somewhat well-defined state, </li>
          <li> and can be interrupted and continued as needed. </li>
        </ol>
        This might be especially true for core
        developers, while external developers might prefer a more traditional model,
        where only at the end the distilled work (using the "cherry-picking" method
        preferred for example by the Git developers) is submitted. However,
        after some initial period of getting used to the continuous process of the
        OKlibrary, also external developers are encouraged to use the
        "continuous model" (and not the "batch model"). </li>
    </ol>
    

    <h2> The testing process </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> All code shall be accompanied by appropriate tests. </li>
      <li> Since most components are generic, "appropriate tests" means
        that actually test <em>functions</em> are to be provided, and this
        as part of the library. </li>
      <li> In this <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_accu2006_talk_location)"> talk </a>
        more general information about the "higher order unit test system"
        provided by the OKlibrary can be found. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Tutorial </h1>

    Provided the basic installations are performed, and you are informed
    about the general ideas, here now you find a general overview on how
    to explore the OKlibrary.

    
    <h2> About external sources </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The external-sources-overview page reachable from the local home
        page shows you the status of the current installations. </li>
      <li> And following the docus-system-link you find under "Buildsystem"
        also a general overview on building external sources. </li>
    </ul>
    The most important external sources you should build (via
    <code>oklib external_source</code>, where for example "external_source"
    is "gcc" or "git") are:
    <ul>
      <li> For compilation:
        <ol>
          <li> The local <code>gcc</code>:
            <ul>
              <li> Especially <code>g++</code> is of importance, and here
                we need to have full control. </li>
              <li> Also the C, Fortran, Prolog and Java compiler which
                come with the suite are of use (here your system version
                might be sufficient --- if you have one). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Necessary libraries:
            <ul>
              <li> <code>Boost</code> </li>
              <li> <code>Ubcsat</code< </li>
              <li> <code>Mhash</code> </li>
              <li> <code>Gmp</code>. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> <code>Doxygen</code> is needed for documentation creation. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> For using the version control system (browsing through the history,
        and making (local or global) changes) <code>Git</code> is needed. </li>
    </ul>


    <h2> About the core library </h2>
    
    On the local home page you find links
    <ul>
      <li> to the root of the docus-system, which gives an overview on each
        level of the OKlibrary; </li>
      <li> the html documentation link then yields the full extracted
        documentation (the docus-system is only a small part of it); </li>
      <li> the main text explains fundamental ideas and rules. </li>
    </ul>
    All build-process (like compilation, running tests, building
    external sources or creating documentation) use the <code>oklib</code>
    program (which you have already encountered during the initial
    installation).


    <h2> The directory structure </h2>

    Of general importance is the directory structure - it's all there to be
    used, so you better familiarise yourself with it.
    <ul>
      <li> Directories starting with small letters are of "systematic nature",
        either to be found at many places like the
        <code>plans</code>-directories, or otherwise they are used by the
        build-system. </li>
      <li> Directories starting with capital letters are "genuine" and of
        singular nature. </li>
    </ul>
    The main idea of the directory structure is that of a strict hierarchy,
    where each internal node is an "administration point" for its subtree.


    <h2> Documentation systems </h2>

    Altogether there are 9 systems which provide structured information
    about the OKlibrary, subdivided as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Internet:
        <ul>
          <li> The main purpose of the <strong>Internet home page</strong>
            of the OKlibrary is to provide download information. </li>
          <li> And a link to the <strong>mailing lists</strong>
            and their archives is given, where the mailing lists are
            mainly a place for announcements, informal discussions and
            questions. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Local pages:
        <ul>
          <li> The thin layer of <strong>local html pages</strong>
            (like this page) is for general discussion of aims and history,
            and to provide general information. </li>
          <li> <strong>Documents</strong> (created by the Latex system, in
            article and book form) provide general theoretical foundations.
            <ul>
              <li> Currently only available at the "global level", with
                general topics for the whole library. </li>
              <li> In the future modules will contain their own texts
                (for a kind of mathematical foundation). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> The <strong>Doxygen system</strong> represents source code
            and accompanying dedicated summary information. </li>
          <li> Embedded into the Doxygen system is the
            <strong>docus system</strong>, which is there for specific
            usage information. </li>
          <li> Also embedded into the Doxygen system is the
            <strong>demos system</strong>, which gives access to the
            demonstration programs (which typically are not there to
            "run and watch", but to study). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <strong>External sources</strong> come with their own
        documentation. </li>
      <li> <strong>Git</strong> (especially <code>gitk</code>) finally
        enables access to the history of the OKlibrary. </li>
    </ul>

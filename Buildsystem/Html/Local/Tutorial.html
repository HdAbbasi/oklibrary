    <h1> Tutorial </h1>

    Provided the basic installations are performed, and you are informed
    about the general ideas, here now you find a general overview on how
    to explore the OKlibrary.

    
    <h2> About external sources </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The external-sources-overview page, reachable from the local home
        page, shows you the status of the current installations. </li>
      <li> And, following the docus-system-link, you find under "Buildsystem"
        also a general overview on building external sources. Quickly:
        <ol>
          <li> Building an external source is done via
            <code>oklib external_source</code>. </li>
          <li> For example <code>oklib git</code> or <code>oklib maxima</code>.
          </li>
          <li> These commands are to be issued (on the command line, as usual)
            in directory "OKplatform/ExternalSources" (or below). </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    The most important external sources you should build are:
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Maxima</strong> (via <code>oklib maxima</code>) provides the
        basic level for SAT experimentation, embedding (generalised) SAT into a
        Lisp-based computer-algebra system. </li>
      <li> In order to be able to compile C++ programs and documentation we
        need the following:
        <ol>
          <li> <strong>Doxygen</strong> (via <code>oklib doxygen</code>) is needed
            for documentation creation. </li>
          <li> The <strong>Gcc</strong> compiler suite (via <code>oklib gcc</code>):
            <ul>
              <li> Especially <code>g++</code> is of importance, and here
                we need to have full control (so normally our installation
                is mandatory). </li>
              <li> Also the C, Fortran, Prolog and Java compiler, which
                come with the suite, are of use, but here your system versions
                might be sufficient (if existent). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Libraries (needed to compile the C/C++ programs of our library):
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Boost</strong> (via <code>oklib boost</code>; but see
                the installation page) </li>
              <li> <strong>Ubcsat</strong> (via <code>oklib ubcsat</code>) </li>
              <li> <strong>Mhash</strong> (via <code>oklib mhash</code>) </li>
              <li> <strong>Gmp</strong> (via <code>oklib gmp</code>). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> For using the version control system, i.e., browsing through the
        history and making (local or global) changes, <strong>Git</strong>
        (via <code>oklib git</code>) is needed. </li>
    </ul>


    <h2> About the core library </h2>
    
    On the local home page you find links
    <ul>
      <li> to the root of the docus-system, which gives an overview on each
        level of the OKlibrary; </li>
      <li> the html documentation link then yields the full extracted
        documentation (the docus-system is only a small part of it); </li>
      <li> the main text explains fundamental ideas and rules. </li>
    </ul>
    All build-process (like compilation, running tests, building
    external sources or creating documentation) use the <code>oklib</code>
    program (which you have already encountered during the initial
    installation).


    <h2> The directory structure </h2>

    Of general importance is the directory structure - it's all there to be
    used, so you better familiarise yourself with it.
    <ul>
      <li> Directories starting with small letters are of "systematic nature",
        either to be found at many places like the
        <code>plans</code>-directories, or otherwise they are used by the
        build-system. </li>
      <li> Directories starting with capital letters are "genuine" and of
        singular nature. </li>
    </ul>
    The main idea of the directory structure is that of a strict hierarchy,
    where each internal node is an "administration point" for its subtree.


    <h2> Documentation systems </h2>

    Altogether there are 9 systems which provide structured information
    about the OKlibrary, subdivided as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Internet:
        <ul>
          <li> The main purpose of the <strong>Internet home page</strong>
            of the OKlibrary is to provide download information. </li>
          <li> And a link to the <strong>mailing lists</strong>
            and their archives is given, where the mailing lists are
            mainly a place for announcements, informal discussions and
            questions. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Local pages:
        <ul>
          <li> The thin layer of <strong>local html pages</strong>
            (like this page) is for general discussion of aims and history,
            and to provide general information. </li>
          <li> <strong>Documents</strong> (created by the Latex system, in
            article and book form) provide general theoretical foundations.
            <ul>
              <li> Currently only available at the "global level", with
                general topics for the whole library. </li>
              <li> In the future modules will contain their own texts
                (for a kind of mathematical foundation). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> The <strong>Doxygen system</strong> represents source code
            and accompanying dedicated summary information. </li>
          <li> Embedded into the Doxygen system is the
            <strong>docus system</strong>, which is there for specific
            usage information. </li>
          <li> Also embedded into the Doxygen system is the
            <strong>demos system</strong>, which gives access to the
            demonstration programs (which typically are not there to
            "run and watch", but to study). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <strong>External sources</strong> come with their own
        documentation. </li>
      <li> <strong>Git</strong> (especially <code>gitk</code>) finally
        enables access to the history of the OKlibrary. </li>
    </ul>

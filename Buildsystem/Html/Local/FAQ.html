  <h1> FAQ </h1>


  <h2> General philosophy </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Why do we build all these external sources?
    <ol>
     <li> One major goal of the OKlibrary is <strong>reproducibility</strong>,
      that is, given the ID of the repository, all experiments performed using
      the OKlibrary should be reproducible. This needs a tight control over the
      environment. </li>
     <li> So we make a separation between "sources important for us", which
      we install, and "background sources", where we don't expect different
      versions to make a difference, and we don't install them, but require
      them from your Linux distribution. </li>
     <li> Running-times are also important to us, and they depend on the
      compilers and libraries used. </li>
     <li> Furthermore, just building and running the many external sources we
      use creates a network of complex requirements. Packages sometimes work
      only with other packages with a special version-number, and many
      packages we use are not included in any Linux distribution </li>
     <li> Often we (need to) improve/correct the packages. </li>
     <li> Another system which (like the OKlibrary) needs to install many and
      diverse "external sources", the SAGE computer algebra system, also
      installs all components like compilers etc. itself --- there is no
      alternative. </li>
     <li> If a user experiences problems, we wouldn't have any chance finding
      out what goes on if major software wouldn't come from the OKlibrary.
     </li>
     <li> Finally, we anyway need a strong system for installing external
      sources for the many non-standard sources we install (e.g. SAT/CSP etc.
      solvers). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Can I adjust the build system?
    <ol>
     <li> The build system of the OKlibrary is designed as an open system.
     </li>
     <li> So in principle nearly everything can be adjusted by changing
      certain variables of the build-system (typically make-variables). </li>
     <li> However this can also create problems nearly impossible to spot,
      for example just forgetting certain special settings. </li>
     <li> And problems will arise in case of some update. </li>
     <li> So you need to know what you are doing, that is, you need to explore
      the system in greater depth --- starting yourself. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> Installation </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> What to do in case of a build-error?
    <ol>
     <li> Often clearly some package is missing. </li>
     <li> Otherwise, in the directory
      <code>OKlib/Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans</code>
      there are plans regarding all the external sources we build, and if we
      are aware of some build problem, then we discuss it there. </li>
     <li> Before re-building, first everything must be cleaned:
      <ul>
       <li> If you were just using "oklib all", then use "oklib cleanall",
        and start again. </li>
       <li> If you were building a special target "XXX", i.e., you used
        "oklib XXX", then use "oklib cleanallXXX" (no space!), and start
        again. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The links in the public bin-directory do not work?
    <ol>
     <li> In <code>OKplatform/bin</code> you find links to the main
      executables produced by the OKlibrary. </li>
     <li> However, some may not work (since they actually point to an
      empty target). </li>
     <li> The problem here is, that these programs first need to be built,
      either by compilation from the OKlibrary itself, or by building
      an external source. </li>
     <li> These build-processes then will provide the target for the
      links. </li>
     <li> Building happens mostly by <code>oklib all</code> (in directory
      <code>OKplatform/OKsystem</code>, for the programs provided by the
      OKlibrary itself). </li>
     <li> Some programs are provided by external sources, and then these
      external sources need to be built, by the appropriate
      <code>oklib external-source</code> (in directory
      <code>OKplatform/ExternalSources</code>). </li>
     <li> In order to create links which were introduced after the initial
      building of the OKlibrary, use <code>oklib --prebuild</code>. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> External sources </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Why do we provide <code>gcc-4.1.2</code> ?
    <ol>
     <li> We have a fixed gcc-version, namely 4.1.2, and a current version,
      rather close to the newest gcc-version. Why this? </li>
     <li> Consider the evolution of C++:
      <ol>
       <li> The first real C++ was C++98; before this first ISO standard,
       many versions floated around. </li>
       <li> Fixing problems we get C++03, a minor revision. </li>
       <li> C++09 now is a major revision, also extending the language.
       It is not yet fully realised by Gcc. </li>
       <li> C++1X will further introduce major features. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> A great thing about C++ is the strength of the standard (the
      "bible"), and all major C++ compilers moved (and are still moving)
      towards greater standard compliance. </li>
     <li> But only now (2011) are the major compilers in a state that
      standard-conforming C++03 can be written --- it's the compiler who tells
      you what is correct and what not! </li>
     <li> So there is a lot of C++ code out there with many weaknesses. </li>
     <li> One of the goals of the OKlibrary is to build up over time a
      repository of "historic solvers", and those won't compile with newer
      compiler versions. </li>
     <li> And if C++ code is not actively maintained, it will likely stop
      compiling at some point. </li>
     <li> Currently the OKlibrary itself does not build with gcc version 4.2.1
      or later, due to the use of non-standard template mechanisms (we weren't
      aware of). We are waiting now for features of C++09 to be included, so
      that the repair becomes easier. </li>
     <li> Gcc version 4.1.2 seems to be a watershed --- starting with version
      4.2.1 a major push towards only providing standard C++ took place (which
      is a good thing), while version 4.1.2 is the most stable version
      supporting most of the old non-standard features. </li>
     <li> Perhaps at some point in the future we need three gcc
      compiler-versions (no problem with the flexible build-system of the
      OKlibrary). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> Problems running programs </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> Runtime linking problems ("libraries not found"):
    <ol>
     <li> We experienced problems with Suse (Linux) distributions, and we
      found that system-wide installation of the package
      <code>binutils-2.20.tar.bz2</code> (available in
      <code>ExternalSources/sources/LinuxTools</code>) solved the problems
      (although the Suse-installed linker had in one case the same major
      version number, nevertheless it produced unnecessary runtime-links which
      caused problems).
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  <h2> The documentation system </h2>

  <ul>
   <li> In the <code>plans</code> directories, all the files are
    <code>.hpp</code>-files, that is, C++ files?
     <ol>
      <li> Most parts of the documentation system are created using
       <em>Doxygen</em>. </li>
      <li> The .hpp-files in plans-directories do only contain C++
      <em>comments</em>, but no actual code. </li>
      <li> And inside the comments the Doxygen-directives are placed, which
       describe documentation (and plans, discussions, etc.). </li>
      <li> The Doxygen-system then <em>creates</em> the html-pages. </li>
      <li> Only some html-pages, like this one, are directly created in the
       html-format, while otherwise we use the Doxygen-system for formatting,
      and, perhaps most important, for link creation. </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> How to find something </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps you want to find whether we implemented something from a
    paper of author XYZ, or you changed the location of file DIR/FILE,
    and you need to change all references to that file. Just search
    for TEXT (=XYZ resp. =DIR/FILE) by the tools provided by Linux (and
    possibly your distribution). Most basic is <code>grep</code>:
    <pre>
OKplatform> grep -rl "TEXT" *
    </pre>
    (where "r" is for "recursive descend" and "l" for "print only
    file-names", while the filename expansion "*" at the end invokes all
    files and directories in the working-directory).
   </li>
   <li>
    I (OK) am using for example xemacs, which produces backup-files marked
    through the suffix "~"; normally you want to exclude such files, and
    then you can use a <code>find</code>-filter:
    <pre>
OKplatform> echo $(find * -not -name "*~" -and -type f) | xargs grep -rl "TEXT"
    </pre>
   </li>
   <li> Using <code>find</code> is very powerful, however just for excluding
    a filename-pattern we can use <code>grep</code>, and the following
    command has the same effect:
    <pre>
OKplatform> grep -rl --exclude="*~" "TEXT" *
    </pre>
    And if you only want to search for plans-files, then you can restrict
    the search to files with suffix ".hpp" by
    <pre>
OKplatform> grep -rl --exclude="*~" --include="*.hpp" "TEXT" *
    </pre>
    (but these filename-patterns only work for the basename; if you want
    to control the full path, then you need to use the more powerful
    <code>find</code>-filter).
   </li>
   <li> Another useful option of <code>grep</code> is "i", for example in the
    form <code>grep -rli</code>, which means that the search pattern matches
    in a case-insensitive manner (useful if you are not sure about the precise
    usage of small and capital letters in the pattern, or if you want to
    capture several such patterns.
   </li>
  </ul>

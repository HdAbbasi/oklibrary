  <h1> FAQ </h1>
  
  
  <h2> Installation </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> The links in the public bin-directory do not work??
    <ol>
     <li> In <code>OKplatform/bin</code> you find links to the main
      executables produced by the OKlibrary. </li>
     <li> However, some do not work (since they actually point to an
      empty target). </li>
     <li> The problem here is, that these programs first need to be built,
      either by compilation from the OKlibrary itself, or by building
      an external source. </li>
     <li> These build-processes then will provide the target for the
      links. </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> How to find something </h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps you want to find whether we implemented something from a
    paper of author XYZ, or you changed the location of file DIR/FILE,
    and you need to change all references to that file. Just search
    for TEXT (=XYZ resp. =DIR/FILE) by the tools provided by Linux (and
    possibly your distribution). Most basic is <code>grep</code>:
    <pre>
OKplatform> grep -rl "TEXT" *
    </pre>
    (where "r" is for "recursive descend" and "l" for "print only
    file-names", while the filename expansion "*" at the end invokes all
    files and directories in the working-directory).
   </li>
   <li>
    I (OK) am using for example xemacs, which produces backup-files marked
    through the suffix "~"; normally you want to exclude such files, and
    then you can use a <code>find</code>-filter:
    <pre>
OKplatform> echo $(find * -not -name "*~" -and -type f) | xargs grep -rl "TEXT"
    </pre>
    Using <code>find</code> is very powerful, however just for excluding
    a filename-pattern we can use <code>grep</code>, and the following
    command has the same effect:
    <pre>
OKplatform> grep -rl --exclude="*~" "TEXT" *
    </pre>
    And if you only want to search for plans-files, then you can restrict
    the search to files with suffix ".hpp" by
    <pre>
OKplatform> grep -rl --exclude="*~" --include="*.hpp" "TEXT" *
    </pre>
    (but these filename-patterns only work for the basename; if you want
    to control the full path, then you need to use the more powerful
    <code>find</code>-filter).
   </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for the core part of the build system, the
  make- or make-like engine


  \todo CMake
  <ul>
   <li> The basic idea of using cmake despite of the problems described below (see also
   the e-mail to the CMake-mailing list from 7.6.2007): Use make to run the cmake-process!
   In Detail:
    <ul>
     <li> As now, every module where we wish to have build-functionality contains a symbolic
     link to a generic makefile (a new one --- just a very simple one (hopefully)).
     Perhaps we call this makefile the "master makefile". </li>
     <li> Such a module contains a .build-subdirectory (seems better to hide it, since
     normally one doesn't want to look into it). </li>
     <li> Creating a new directory is now a target for the master makefile: It creates
     the .build-directory, places inside it the cmake-file, and runs the cmake-process. </li>
     <li> For the normal tasks like "all" or "check" the master makefile just calls
     the (created) makefile in .build. </li>
     <li> While adding a new file is now also a task of the master makefile, which calls the
     cmake-makefile in .build (to recreate the makefile in .build). </li>
     <li> For this to work we need the capability of cmake to place the cmake-makefile
     as well as the makefile somewhere else than in the source-directory. </li>
     <li> Having the .build-directory in the source-tree creates considerable
     space overhead (relevant when copying the source-tree, as it happens when
     using it on the laptop), and likely it is not advisable to have
     build-information in the source-tree: So, given that we are free where to place
     the cmake-file, we should place the build-directory in system_directories/aux
     (or system_directories/build?). </li>
     <li> What is the cmake-file in .build? Three possibilities:
      <ol>
       <li> A copy of the generic cmake-file. </li>
       <li> A symbolic link to the generic cmake-file. </li>
       <li> A created cmake-file (created from a generic template and some
       parameters). </li>
      </ol>
      Obviously, creating a customised cmake-file is most powerful, but one needs
      could reasons for that --- and a good design, with a clear idea about
      the different levels of indirection! </li>
     <li> The aim is to use in this way all the build-in facilities of cmake, while
     overcoming its restricted power. </li>
     <li> If cmake has not enough power for computing (and manipulating) file-lists, then
     the master makefile could compute them and pass them to cmake; a problem here could be
     that this must happen via the command line (?), and then there is the restricted
     command-line length?!? </li>
     <li> The additional level of indirection (given by the master makefile) seems necessary,
     since we want complete automisation, while cmake itself does nothing than creating
     makefile --- and the makefiles created are not "dynamic" but "static" (rather restricted
     in power). The abstract division of work between the three layers can be understood as
     follows:
      <ol>
       <li> The master-makefile-level does not do real building, but only its fileprocessing
       capabilities are needed (so actually a shell-script could be used?!). </li>
       <li> The cmake-level has the knowledge of how to build things. </li>
       <li> Finally, the created makefiles are purely static, and master dependencies (and,
       or course, actually perform the build-actions). </li>
      </ol>
      One should think about using a shell-script instead of a master-makefile! The main disadvantage
      seems to be that the syntax "make target" couldn't be used.
     </li>
    </ul>
   <li> Can cmake handle our "fractal" or "recursive" directory structure, where we have
   arbitrary nested subdirectories, inside we find standard functional (sub-sub-)directories like
   "tests", "testobjects", "demos", "apps", "messages", "plans", "docus", and from these
   functional directories the source-code files are to be extracted, and name-surgery is
   applied to compute the corresponding directories under system_directories ?!? </li>
   <li> Can cmake handle the uniformity of our system, where for Transitional we only have
   2 makefiles (OKlibBuilding/Makefile and Recursive.mak), and every directory contains (if wished) only
   a symbolic link to one of those (utilising then the definitions.mak files) ?!? We do not
   want to clutter the source directory with code for the build system, but at any point we want
   to be able to issue a make-command. </li>
   <li> Can cmake handle the dynamic aspects of our build system, where with every make-command
   all the programs and libraries to be compiled and all executables to be executed are first determined
   dynamically, namely what exists currently in the source-code tree?!?
    <ol>
     <li> The possibilities to manipulate variables seem very restricted?? There seem to
     exist no functions??? </li>
     <li> What is needed is a "meta-make", which from configuration values, parameter
     values and the current state of the file-system first creates all targets, corresponding
     names and paths etc., and then creates the make-file. One would guess that this
     exactly should be possible with cmake?? With make we have the possibility due to
     the two-stages concept, but it's hard to create the dependencies on the target. </li>
     <li> So ADD_EXECUTABLE and ADD_LIBRARY depend on the output of a shell-command (typically "find")
     --- this doesn't seem possible? But with FOREACH and WHILE it should be possible. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> It seems one doesn't have fine-grained control over the separation of the cmake-specific files
   and the library- and binary-files? Apparently cmake expects the user to issue a final "install"
   command, which will put the lib- and bin-files to their "final" destination?!? But we have
   a continuous process! </li>
   <li> It seems that the basic idea between the higher-level "cmake" and the lower-level "make" is
   here, that every time a new files is introduced (or something similar), one must run cmake, while
   otherwise one can just run make. Seems not unreasonable, but of course one introduces a further
   possibility for making mistakes ?!? </li>
   <li> It seems that the special makefile for external sources is the best
   candidate for employing cmake; see "Using CMake" in Buildsystem/ExternalSources/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> Investigate how our main tasks can be handled by cmake. </li>
   <li> How would the work flow be with the new system (the 2 levels,
   the cmake- and the make-level)? </li>
   <li> The cmake-files should use decomposition into smaller cmake-files
   (this should now be easier), and we also need a library of cmake-macros. </li>
   <li> Is ccmake useful? DONE (just a program for setting configuration variables, so yes, it is
   useful for that purpose) </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Competition extraction tools
  <ul>
   <li> These tools, for a given program build a package, which contains
   all necessary source code and can be build using make (producing then
   the executable). </li>
   <li> A problem here are the link-libraries. Without them, one could use
   the ability of g++ to produce compilation units (using the option "-E"
   like "g++ -E Program.cpp -o Program.ii"), putting everything into one
   big file. </li>
   <li> Knowing the link-libraries, just compiling Program.ii with the
   right .o-files yields the program. </li>
   <li> So when we know all compilation units, we can preprocess them all
   and putting them into the package; the package just compiles the units
   separately, and then links them together. </li>
  </ul>

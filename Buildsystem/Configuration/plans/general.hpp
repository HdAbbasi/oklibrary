  \brief Plans regarding configuration management


  \todo Configuration data overview :
  We need to get an overview on the different types of configuration data.
  <ul>
   <li> Build-related </li>
   <li> External sources:
    <ol>
     <li> See Buildsystem/ExternalSources/plans/Configuration.hpp. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> html-pages </li>
   <li> The doxygen system (see "Definitions for doxygen" below). </li>
   <li> Personal information:
    <ol>
     <li> See Buildsystem/Configuration/plans/Persons.hpp. </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>


  \todo Configuration data format
  <ul>
   <li> Standardisation of naming configuration variables:
    <ol>
     <li> Perhaps a directory gets the prefix "dir_", and a main directory
     "Directory" is then called "dir_Directory". </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Perhaps for defining configuration variables we should always first
   check whether it's already defined, and if not, then look for an
   environment variable. </li>
   <li> In order that the configuration-variables become available, the
   corresponding master-process has to be invoked by some makefile; so likely
   over time a collection of small specialised makefiles arises. </li>
   <li> Splitting the definitions over several files is likely preferable
   from the order point of view. Shouldn't be too complicated to use them.
   </li>
   <li> Configuration variables shall follow the rules for C-names (so no
   hyphens for example), since otherwise the shell can't handle them. </li>
   <li> In directory .oklib a file "override.mak" is placed, where overriding
   definitions of configuration variables are to be put (for example variable
   ExternalSources could be redefined here, to use the external sources of
   another OKplatform-installation). DONE </li>
   <li> Should the configuration-make-variables be recursive or not? Recursive
   variables give more power ("one never knows"), and so at the moment the
   decision is to make all configuration-make-variables recursive.
   DONE (recursive variables are needed, so that definitions can be
   overriden) </li>
   <li> DONE (we use makefiles with makevariable-definitions for all
   configuration data)
     We could use makefile-syntax, that is, we have make-files containing
     only variable settings
     \verbatim
CONFIGVAR1=value1
CONFIGVAR2=value2
     \endverbatim
     To be used by the C preprocessor, this has to be translated into
     \verbatim
#define CONFIGVAR1 value1
#define CONFIGVAR2 value2
     \endverbatim
     This seems to work whatever value1 is (as long value1 does not contain
     line breaks).
     To be used by m4, this has to be translated into
     \verbatim
m4_define(CONFIGVAR1,value1)
m4_define(CONFIGVAR2,value2)
     \endverbatim
     while for usage by cmake the translation is
     \verbatim
SET(CONFIGVAR1 value1)
SET(CONFIGVAR2 value2)
     \endverbatim
     In both cases there might be problems if value1 for example contains
     a closing bracket? Perhaps we could just use the export-facility of make,
     so that these variables become environment variables?!? But then we would
     loose control.
   </li>
   <li> The solution seems to be not to do translations, but to have all
   configuration-variables defined in makefiles as as make-variables.
   Via the export-function then we have all them plus the environment
   variables at hand, and every other usage of configuration variables
   (doxygen or an html-preprocessor) just accesses environment variables.
   DONE (we do as proposed here) </li>
   <li> If we are going to use CMake, then perhaps the variable settings should
     be done in the cmake-syntax. DONE (the cmake-transition, if at all, can
     happen only after we have a running make-system) </li>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Primary versus derived configurations
  <ul>
   <li> The primary configurations are under version control. </li>
   <li> Derived values (like source- and link-libraries for external libraries)
   are to be found perhaps in system_directories/configurations ? There might
   be also a symbolic link to the primary configurations? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Variables for accessing external libraries (was
  system_definitions.mak):
  <ul>
   <li> Boost:
    <ul>
     <li> If the variable includes the "-I", then for other
     variables we use a suffix "_include", which we should also
     do for the boost-variables. </li>
     <li> We need a precise and central definition of those
     boost-variables. </li>
     <li> The default value of Boost
     <code> -I/usr/local/boost-1_34_0 </code>
     is stale; the recommended Boost version number is needed. DONE
      <ul>
       <li> So for every external library Extlib the default value
       of the Make variable Extlib should be deduced the recommended version 
       number? DONE (yes) </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> The boost-variable definitions are inconsistent with
     the rest of the build-system, so they should be reverted (as
     discussed). DONE </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> The role of system_definitions.mak must be clarified.
   Do those library variables (Boost, Ubcsat) belong to it??
   No: They must go the Configuration/ExternalSources --- for every external
   sources there one finds variables yielding access to the resources provided
   by it. DONE
   <ul>
    <li> system_definitions.mak should
    contain definitions of Make variables which are used by
    several makefiles. However, the prefix "system_" also implies that 
    these variables belong to the OKlibrary and not to the external
    sources, so perhaps the definitions of variables relevant
    for the external sources are moved elsewhere. DONE </li>
    <li> Perhaps all variable definitions relevant for the 
    external sources (including version numbers) should go into
    ExternalSources/definitions.mak? DONE (they go for example to
    Configuration/ExternalSources/gcc.mak)
    <ol>
     <li> What about that "ExternalSources/definitions_.mak" ?
     (This name seems strange to me anyway.) DONE (merged into
     ExternalSources/Makefile) </li>
     <li> The main question is about visibility. There needs to be fixed
     the architecture of our makefiles (w.r.t. inclusion and variable
     definitions). DONE (handled by the new configuration system) </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li> What is the precise relation to external_sources_versions.mak ?
   DONE (all variables related to external sources must leave
   system_definitions.mak) </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Definitions for doxygen:
  <ul>
   <li> General make-functions are needed to overcome the restrictions on using
   configuration-variables in doxygen-documentation (see for example the
   function doxygen_html_documentation_index_location_tag in
   Configuration/ExternalSources/doxygen.mak). </li>
   <li> It would be preferable, if the following variable definitions
    <ol>
     <li> ALIASES </li>
     <li> PREDEFINED </li>
     <li> EXPAND_AS_DEFINED </li>
     <li> FILE_PATTERNS </li>
    </ol>
    would come from Configuration/doxygen_documentation.mak. </li>
    <li> For all settings we should have specific configuration variables.
    </li>
   <li> With every new version of doxygen, the update-wizzard of doxygen has
   to be run on the created doxyfile, one has to study the changes, and then
   one has to update the master-doxyfile accordingly. First update the created
   Doxyfile
   \verbatim
OKplatform/system_directories/aux> doxygen -u Doxyfile
   \endverbatim
   and after studying these changes, update the template
   \verbatim
Transitional/Buildsystem/Configuration> doxygen -u Doxyfile
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> DONE (doxygen_parameters deleted, since not needed --- parameters can
   also be specified on the command-line)
   Mention in the documentation, that via "doxygen_parameters" one can set
   variables from the doxygen-configuration-file (as an example present the
   switch to German). </li>
   <li> How can we reliably refer to a specific page within the doxygen
   documentation? Are the url's relatively stable? DONE (yes, they are --- the
   temporary problem was an md5-doxygen bug) </li>
   <li> The Doxyfile should be part of the (primary) configuration system.
   DONE </li>
   <li> Perhaps it's best to define a "master-doxyfile" in the primary
   configuration system, containing macros or includes for the above four
   definitions, and then the build system builds the finale Doxyfile (in the
   derived configurations) in dependency on these includes/macro-definitions.
   (Alternatively, one can specify directly a doxyfile to be used --- how to
   achieve this with cmake? In the normal case, target html depends on the
   doxyfile to be created if necessary, but if some variable is specified on
   the make command line, then the doxyfile is not used.) DONE (we have the
   Doxyfile in Buildsystem/Configuration, and we use m4-preprocessing) </li>
   <li> Allows the Doxyfile for includes or macro expansion? See
   "Environment-variable expansion" in
   Buildsystem/OKlibBuilding/Targets/html/plans/general.hpp.
   DONE (yes, but we use the m4-system) </li>
  </ul>

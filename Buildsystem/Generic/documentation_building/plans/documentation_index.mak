  \brief Plans for the documentation index makefile

  \todo Different organisation:
   - centering the document (OK: looks odd to me, squeezed to the left margin)
   - organisation in columns: DONE
   - emphasising the links: DONE

  \todo Logo : DONE

  \todo Version numbers
   - The version number of Transitional shouldn't be hard-coded --- we need some
     central organisation.
   - Instead of "v0.0.1" we should have "Transitional Version 0.1.0" : DONE

  \todo OKlibrary link
   - The documentation for OKlibrary should stand out from the others : DONE
   - Perhaps we have a section just for the OKlibrary which has links to the
     documentation for the html documentation and also links to the 
     meta-documentation : DONE

  \todo Improved logo:
   - yet the colour is a bit too lavenderish
   - perhaps a tiny bit of space between "OK" and "library" (looks squeezed)

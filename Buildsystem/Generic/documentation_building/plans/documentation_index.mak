  \brief Plans for the documentation index makefile

  \todo Different organisation:
   OK: I like lists, enumerations etc. So we could have 3 columns, the first with
   a list for the OKlibrary docu, the second with a list for local docu, and
   the third for the WWW docu.

   Perhaps "OKlibrary" and the rest of the heading centered, then some introductory
   paragraph, and then the above three columns (using a larger font for the column
   headings).

   Another problem with the current links is, that it is not visible that we have
   links (only when moving the mouse over them something can be seen).

  \todo Logo
   - Perhaps the logo can be improved. Maybe just blue, without any gradient.
   - An possible alternative is not to use any logo, and only use the stylesheet
     to specify a nice font.
     OK: I liked the logo we had --- only the colours had to be improved.

  \todo Version numbers
   - Instead of "v0.0.1" we should have "Transitional Version 0.1.0" : DONE
   - The version number of Transitional shouldn't be hard-coded --- we need some
     central organisation.

  \todo OKlibrary link
   - The documentation for OKlibrary should stand out from the others : DONE
   - Perhaps we have a section just for the OKlibrary which has links to the
     documentation for the html documentation and also links to the 
     meta-documentation : DONE

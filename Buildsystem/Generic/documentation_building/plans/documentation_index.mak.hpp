  \brief Plans for the documentation index makefile

  \bug This file should be renamed to documentation_index.hpp.

  \todo Page organisation
   - On my laptop the columns are arranged in two rows (independent of the horizontal space
     available (a lot)). So something with the dimensions seems to be wrong.
   - In documentation_index_style.css one finds hard-coded dimensions --- this doesn't look right.

  \todo Using css:
  Is it really worth it? The main page of the OKlibrary documentation likely will forevery just
  stay one page, so the generality enabled by css will likely never be used. But it seems that
  creating web pages is much more complicated in the css-way?
  What tools exist to create easily such web pages?

  \todo Meta tags:
   - All the documentation should be available (finally) on the web; thus the index page will become
     a publically available web page, and needs all the meta tags, and also all the other declarations
     available, about encoding, last change date etc..

  \todo Improved logo:
   - yet the colour is a bit too lavenderish (a touch of arker blue perhaps)
   - perhaps a tiny bit of space between "OK" and "library" (looks squeezed)
   - some comments on how the logo has been created are needed.

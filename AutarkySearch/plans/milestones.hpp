  \par Current version 0.0.3 (10.9.2006)

  \par Version 0.0.4 :
  In AutarkySearch/plans/AutarkySearch.hpp the topic
  "First implementation for AnalyseTotalAssignment" is further expanded,
  and (further) milestones are updated and created.

  \par Version 0.0.5 :
  In AutarkySearch/plans/AutarkySearch.hpp the topic
  "Local installation of UBCSAT" is handled.
  QUESTION (OK): Shouldn't "First implementation for AnalyseTotalAssignment"
  come later than "Local installation of UBCSAT" ?
  ANSWER (ML) 0.0.4 just means to expand plans, 0.0.5 is to install UBCSAT and 
  then 0.1 is the actual first implementation.

  \par version 0.0.9
  We have successfully used all the UBCSAT triggers and their data structures 

  \par Version 0.1 :
  We have a first implementation using the method of AnalyseTotalAssignment,
  and start experimentation.

  \par Version 1.0 :
  Completely within the OKlibrary we can search for autarkies analysing total
  assignments or searching through partial assignments.

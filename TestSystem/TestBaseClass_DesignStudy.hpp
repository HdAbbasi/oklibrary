  \brief The (user) base class TestSystem::TestBase of the "test-function" hierarchy.

  "Test-functions" test (higher) type parameters; they are used either by other test-functions,
  or they are used to create test objects, to be executed by TestSystem::RunTest.

  Besides the base class TestBase of the test-class-hierarchy, macros
   - OKLIB_TEST_CLASS
   - OKLIB_TEST_CLASS_C
   - OKLIB_TEST_CLASS_C1

  are defined to ease the definition of test classes.

    /*!
      \class TestBase
      \brief Derived from class Test, to be used as base class for test-meta-functions (by the user
      of the test system).

      Test-meta-functions F are derived from TestBase; the construction of F passes information
      about the identity of F to the base class, and private member functions F::test, overloaded on
      the (static) test level, are responsible for performing the test (F::test receives the log-stream
      as second parameter, passed to the base class, which is responsible for managing the log-stream).

      The public members are:
      <ul>
       <li> the (virtual) destructor </li>
       <li> member function set_depth. </li>
      </ul>

       In principle the nesting level could be set (once and for all) during construction, however in our way
       it is easier to have parameterised tests, where the parameters are passed to the constructor of the
       test-object. So for example we can use
       OKLIB_TEST_RETHROW(::OKlib::Module::tests::Test(x));
       where x is a parameter: OKLIB_TEST_RETHROW doesn't need to assume anything on the construction
       of the test-object, but can assume it has been constructed, and then changes the nesting-level *afterwards*.
       It would need more complex macro-programming to enable syntax like
       OKLIB_TEST_RETHROW(::OKlib::Module::tests::Test);
       OKLIB_TEST_RETHROW(::OKlib::Module::tests::Test, x);
       OKLIB_TEST_RETHROW(::OKlib::Module::tests::Test, x, y);
       set_depth is used by OKLIB_TEST_RETHROW to (re)set the new testobject, and thus must be public
       (although it does not really belong to the interface of TestBase).

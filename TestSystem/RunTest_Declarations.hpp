      \class RunTest
      \brief Responsible for running tests

      Objects of type RunTest are initialised with a pointer to a TestSystem::Test object,
      and the pointer is put into a global container.
      Via the static member function RunTest::run_test all these tests are executed.

      Meaning of the three output-streams passed to run_tests:
       - err : error messages (extracted from the exceptions thrown by test-meta-functions)
       - messages : messages from the test system, reporting on the general progress
       - log : messages by the test-meta-functions (typically reporting on special test conditions).

  \brief Plans for the core test program

  \todo Messages:
  Using module Messages.
  \todo Infos:
  Complete the printed information about the input (output if the number of input parameters is not as expected).
    We also need a more formal description of the set of possible inputs.

  \todo ProgramOptions:
  Using module ProgramOptions. In this way we also get more components, which can be tested.

  \todo Transition:
  Once the transition is done, rename "TestProgram_DesignStudy.hpp" to "TestProgram.hpp", and check the doxygen-documentation (extending it as needed).

  \todo Messages
  <ul>
   <li> Using module Messages. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Infos
  <ul>
   <li> Complete the printed information about the input (output if the number
   of input parameters is not as expected). </li>
   <li> We also need a more formal description of the set of possible inputs.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo ProgramOptions
  <ul>
   <li> Using module ProgramOptions. </li>
   <li> In this way we also get more components, which can be tested. </li>
   <li> Here also input-checking takes place. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Transition
  <ul>
   <li> Once the transition is done, rename "TestProgram_DesignStudy.hpp" to
   "TestProgram.hpp". </li>
   <li> And check the doxygen-documentation (extending it as needed). </li>
  </ul>

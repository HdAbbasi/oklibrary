  \brief Plans for the temporary module on cryptological tools


  \todo Update:
  First an overview on the content of the module, and what to do with it, is needed.
  <ul>
   <li> A new module "Cryptology" should be created, with all these tools
   (perhaps best in part "Structures"). </li>
   <li> Most important is to create a concept for
   AES-encoding/decoding, choosing some reasonable implementation
   (Kryptologie/rijndael.hpp and Kryptologie/rijndael.cpp seem to be fine,
   at least for the start), and writing a wrapper for it (of course,
   testing it). </li>
  </ul>

  \brief Plans for the parsing modules


  \todo Move this module to part Programming.


  \todo Create a milestones file.


  \todo Either change the name of the module to "Parser", or change the namespace to "Parsing".


  \todo Update the doxygen-documentation for this module.


  \todo Decide what to do with this module, and with parsing in general:
  <ul>
   <li> Is Boost::Spirit to be used? </li>
   <li> What about regular expressions in the extended Standard library? </li>
   <li> Are there new facilities in Boost 1.34 ? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Transfer the tests to the new system (where are the current test functions used?)

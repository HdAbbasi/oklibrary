  \brief Plans for the (old) module on "general" components

  \todo Transition

  At the end of the day, all the components in this module
  should be transferred (and updated and extended) to appropriate
  (new) modules (then working inside namespace OKlib).

  This might take a while (for the whole module),
  and an intermediate step is to update the tests to the new
  test system.
